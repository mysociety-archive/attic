      <h1>Looking for GroupsNearYou?</h1>
      <p>GroupsNearYou was a mySociety project running from 2008 to 2011. It
      aimed to provide information about local online community groups and
      mailing lists.</p>

        <p>GroupsNearYou was founded in the belief that there’s a proven real
        world social value to people belonging to very local email lists and
        other forms of local online community.</p>

        <p>At the time of its founding, information about such groups was
        spread across a variety of different platforms – the idea was to bring
        it all together in one useful directory, which, through its API, would
        be free for any developer to use in their own projects. It was an early
        example of a site that used the power of crowd-sourcing to useful
        effect.</p>

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>GroupsNearYou closed in 2011 due to data quality problems: there
        were too many false positives and groups that were miscategorised, and
        we were not able to produce data of a useful enough standard within the
        budget we had available. This lack of quality meant that we could not
        actually deploy the data to serve users of our other sites (such as
        FixMyStreet), or encourage other people to do so on their websites.</p>

        <p>GroupsNearYou was one of several useful social projects conceived
        and run by mySociety, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/projects/">many
            of which</a> continue to flourish. It just wasn't possible to give
        the necessary time and resources to all of them, and so we now focus on
        running our core sites and providing support to international
        partners.

        <h2>Would you like to run GroupsNearYou yourself?</h2>

        <p>We believe that there is still a real need for geocoded data on the
        whereabouts and preoccupations of community groups, but we won’t be
        able to support a site like this ourselves. If you’d like to take over
        GroupsNearYou, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/contact/">get in
            touch</a> and we’ll tell you what’s involved.</p>
