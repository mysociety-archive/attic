	<dd><p>In truth, I will vote, as long as my voting card arrives.  I also believe that voting should be compulsory, even if you spoil your ballot paper or they add a 'none of the above' option (preferably with an option to say why).<br />Whilst this site seems to be proving that there are a large number of people who choose not to vote for a variety of reasons (some clearly more valid than others), I'm sorry to say that of the proportion of people who don't vote at all, I'm convinced that the majority of non-voters fail to turn out because they simply can't be arsed.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jeffrey</strong> replies:</em> Or that they feel it has no effect.  My 1 vote will have very little effect on the overal outcome.  Plus I have never seen or heard of the candidates in my constituency.  And 1 hour of my time to get to a polling station, vote and come back really isn't worth it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Yup, can't be arsed is dead right. I can't be arsed, for a load of (IMO) very good reasons; not least amongst them is that I am vehemently opposed to the idea that we need a centralised government at all.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> I could explain in detail but I just can't be arsed ;o) Warringh tribes would be more democratic - and more natural; man is, after all, an animal, with animal drives. But no; direct democracy is the answer. The system we have today is an anachronism; it dates back to times when communications (transport and tele) were difficult if not impossible. Today we have the post; internet; text messaging; interactive TV; etc etc. We could quite easily make our own decisions and decide which issues are important. We don't need a bunch of fat old men talking shop in a talking shop shop and deciding for us what we need or what is good for us. We could and should be doing it ourselves.</p>

	<p><em><strong>monkeynuts</strong> replies:</em> yeah yeah, participative democracy is a fine idea in theory, but it's ridiculously impractical.</p> <p>I'm all in favour of increasing participation in the democratic process, but there simply aren't enough people with enough time, education or inclination to make properly informed decisions on executive policy.</p> <p>As I see it, the only practical solution to increasing participation is to devolve certain policy and spending decisions to regional government, which tends to be more representative of the local communities, and allow for local residents the opportunity to help shape the local policy.</p> <p>Do you honestly believe that if such a large proportion of the citizens of this country don't vote in the bits of democracy they <em>can</em> participate in, they would somehow magically be more motivated to take part  in a decision on policy issues?</p> <p>You'd end up with a small number of people who consider themselves to be 'enlightened' bothering to take part in the decision-making, looking after their own vested interests (or those of the highest bidder).  Which isn't massively different to what we have now.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy</strong> replies:</em> Monkey, have to argue the "ridiculously impractical" part of your comments, it's perfectly practical if someone could be bothered to invest some time into it.</p> <p>I think you might find that people would be more inclined to vote, and more often, if they felt their vote actually did something.</p> <p>As I said on my original comment on this site, no matter who I vote for my wishes and what I want are irrelevant.  However, if I could make a direct vote on certain issues; well, that is a whole new ball game.</p>

	<p><em><strong>M.Gandhi</strong> replies:</em> Gavin seems to think that Government represents an advance on "warring tribes."</p> <p>In fact warring tribes have never killed a fraction of the number people wiped out - and still being wiped out - by governments.</p> <p>As my great namesake, Mahatma Gandhi once put it when he was asked what he thought of Western civilisation: "I think it would be a good idea."</p> <p> </p>
