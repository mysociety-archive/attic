	<p><em><strong>Rhys Lord</strong> replies:</em> I will be voting in the next election. However I couldn't agree any more strongly with your view.</p> <p>Not only would voting for your own views cut out the need for biased MP's with their own agenda's, it would also free up their paypackets to use on public services.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Boojam</strong> replies:</em> Referenda on each policy is an appalling idea. Why should someone who knows nothing about, say, farming have an equal influence on agricultural policy to someone who is a farmer, an expert, or an MP who has talked to lots of farmers (and is accountable to them) , and so therefore has at least some vague clue about what needs to be done.</p> <p>The problem with the public is that they are not accountable to anyone, and would be able to make as many ignorant and prejudiced voting decisions as they liked without having any clue about the effects of their decisions. Political systems need feedback, so that we know whether decisions are good or bad. Your suggestion would have no such feedback systems.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ben73</strong> replies:</em> Boojam - "many ignorant and prejudiced voting decisions" - don't MP's do this anyway then?<br />Also - you assume MP's know everything about  subjects being voted upon in the House!! </p> <p>As far as I'm concerned, when the public have the power to vote on anything they want to themselves, without your overpaid, hidden-agenda ridden MP doing it for you, then we can call ourselves a true democracy.</p> <p>As it is, we have several hundred people (when they all turn up), voting on issues which either don't affect them  at all, or are probably taking backhanders on anyway.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Janet</strong> replies:</em> Problem on both sides. Politicians - tow a party line on issues not free to form their own opinions - are minister of 'this' one minute and minister of 'that' the next,for which they may have no particular experience or even interest - and their superiors are being told what to do by the unelected EU commission and corporate chiefs.</p> <p>The public on the other hand are fed propoganda and 'dumbed down' information by the media and education (indoctrination) system.</p> <p>Where can we turn for reasonable,wise,compassionate decision making? A Jedi council perhaps?</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
