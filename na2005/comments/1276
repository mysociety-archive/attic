	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> I agree, however I have to say that if I were made PM I would start a new regime and bring back the beliefs, ethics, standards, power, fear, strengnth, honour, and gods of the the ancient Roman Empire and the shiny armour to go with our new legions. And not your namby pamby bobbys on the beat, but  armoured legions with broad swords, ( that`l scare the yobbos off the streets. Hence forth a new, respected and more powerful Britain shall emerge. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> Absolutely, I am quite sure that the present United States as it is currently known would not only prosper but feel more at home in the cradle of the new Britian, with the values of the ancient Roman empire stated above that I would unleash upon the world as PM.</p> <p>Only this way can the US become truly civilised and of course all of America`s military will come under the control of the new Britain, insuring world peace, harmony and stability. However, if required military force will be taken against any state outside the new empire wishing to threaten or pervert our freedom and strength. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Mark Golding</strong> replies:</em> Tiger, would you be willing to put your time and effort into getting involved in Direct Democracy?<br />Email me at office@markgolding.com, I'm recruiting. Ignore my Christian sentiments for now. I too am a political animal and I too want to see the current ancien regime undergo a considerable facelift if not deep surgery.<br />If you like belonging to the Village Green Debating Society, like many on this site,  and don't like political action, don't bother to contact me.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To Spartacus... I`m hoping you are the redeeming character in this forum. Fistly to your question, "Is this a gay chatroom" As for myself I have a harem of women falling over themselves for my rather generous affections. As for the rest of the motley bunch on this forum. Well lets just put it this way, I would be very concerned for my manhood if I were ever in their company.</p> <p>By the way Spartacus, that was a very brave attempt by you and the rest of the slaves to challenge the might of the Roman army when you revolted. Us Romans appreciate a fighter, even if it was against us. We salute you.</p>

<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
