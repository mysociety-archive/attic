	<dd><p>The lesser of two evils argument no longer works, I cannot, categorically, vote Conservative, I have deep personal reservations brought on by growing up in Thatcher's Britain. I cannot, it seems, vote Labour, as they no longer represent the socialist viewpoint I took them for when I first voted. The Lib dems make their beds with whoever will get them power, the Greens haven't a hope in hell and over-emphasise their environmental policies. UKIP, Veritas, the BNP, I don't ever intend to vote for racism. What can I do except spoil my ballot? There is no other way to register my discontent.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Matthew Brown</strong> replies:</em> Whilst no party will ever reflect totally your opinion, shouldn't you vote for the one that most closely matches it? Whilst Labour once stood closer to your point of you, it still seems that it is the party that you most closely identify with. And a lot of that socialism still exists in the back-benches.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Corinne Pritchard</strong> replies:</em> Yes, I'm aware of that. But for every remaining true socialist there is a New Labour lackey willing to strike down their values at Tony Blair's whip. I *want* to vote Labour, but New Labour feels like a foreign country, with its prevarication over Europe, its path of least resistance policies on hospital privatisation, its unwillingness to tackle the Conservative blunders that weakened the system, instead letting them run their course.</p> <p>The entire country voted for socialism, and it didn't get it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jax</strong> replies:</em> The Greens are the only proper anti-corperate party, sure they wont win, but a vote still counts for them.<br />Might make the major parties think differently if other parties start getting more votes.</p> <p>Sure their environmental policies are bit harsh, but as you say they wont get in, so it's ok to vote that way.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris</strong> replies:</em> The Greens seem to be a good home for socialists and I am considering voting for them.  They seem to have more support than they actually get votes...if we don't vote for the best party, we will always have the problems we have today.  Vote with your principles, not by judging who will win.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> I have to take issue with Matthew Brown's comments when listening to the current Labour Government. I hear time and time again that if it's in the manifesto then they have a mandate to do it. Well true but what sort of mandate is it when it's not even half of those that vote and bearly half the electorate have voted and amongst these supporters are plenty who probably only agree with a portion of the programme.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Richard</strong> replies:</em> The problem with the current voting system is that voting by your principles often doesn't give you any representation in government whatsoever. You often have to compromise those principles to some degree  in order to acheive representation within government for at least some of your views, else what would be the point of voting in the first place?<br />Wouldn't it be great if your vote was transferable? If you could place your green party candidate first, and then in the event that they don't get enough vote, your vote is transfered to your second choice and so on. You could even make sure that racist groups like the BNP never get in power, by making sure they are your least preferable.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ed</strong> replies:</em> Further to Jon's post, re. "Lib dems make their beds with whoever will get them power" not only has Kennedy made the announcement that they wouldn't share power, on a more general level the Lib Dems are convinced that there's currently a shift in the political system. See their rejection of the old left-right analysis and their very stark movement away from Labour, which drew uncharacteristically heated reactions from Blair in PMQs over the last few years.<br />All in all, lumping all the parties into one pot appears to me to be a short-cut to thinking.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Corinne Pritchard</strong> replies:</em> The Libdems won't make a pact with Labour? Perhaps you missed the bit about how terrified the idea of a Tory government makes me. That the Libdems would even consider allying with the Conservatives at *any* point for *any* reason fills me with revulsion.</p> <p>As for the Greens, I'm one of the few people whose looked at their social policy and I happen to agree with the vast majority of it. However, they over-emphasize their environmental policy to a ridiculous degree, advertising themselves as a "forsaking everything else, we'll save the environment" party, something which I find incredibly blinkered. Until they get their act together and stop running on a single-issue policy, I won't even consider giving them my vote.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dan</strong> replies:</em> Now that's a quote of the day - the Greens "over-emphasise their environmental policy"...! Never expected that one! I, to be honest, prefer them as a single issue party, which removes the quandry I have with the other parties which each have policies that I agree with and policies I don't agree with (or are just plain abhorrent). Vote green, get a bunch of die-hard environmentalists. Hardly rocket science...</p>
