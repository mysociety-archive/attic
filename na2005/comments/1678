	<p><em><strong>Ray</strong> replies:</em> Let Michael Howard say it is not racist to increase heat on immigrants. It is life that has been wasted. Hope the murderers are caught with just the same zeal that Police would have done in case of white victims. I say this because I see no news about it at BBC news site. Is this murder being blacked out?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ayaz</strong> replies:</em> That is a shame. Half of my family are muslim, but I do not think that they would be attacked whilst going to vote on polling day.</p> <p>I assume that you must bear the appearance of an 'Islamic fundamentalist' (i.e skull cap and beard), for the reason of being targeted.</p> <p>However, that is an extreme case, unfortunatly tragic and down to night time violence and drunkardness</p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> Ayaz: Yes I do have small beard - you may find such beard on may white faces; that does not put them to any risk of being tagged as muslims. No, my appearance otherwise is perfectly western. But I cant help about colour of skin - it is not white. </p> <p>By the way, for that matter, does appearing Islamic fundamentalist worse than appearing Orthodox Christian or Jew with skull cap and long dress with threads (I fail to recall its name at the moment) or Long caps. Should life be taken away because one looks as if he belongs to particular religion? </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>MattD..</strong> replies:</em> Dear me! Are we now so shallow in this country that we can tell from appearance how someone is politically aligned? It is but a short stride from that to mob rule, torches and pitchforks at the ready.</p> <p>I am saddened by your story. Everyone in this country should have a right to vote and to have peaceful opinions, regardless of how they appear. Islam is a peaceful religion that has been twisted by the media into something sinister. Hopefully, they will soon realise the grave mistake they are making.</p> <p>I am not a follower of the Islam faith (I'm actually agnostic). I simply believe in equality for all, regardless of how they look and dress. It is intent and deed that matters, not race, religion and appearance. Perhaps we need look no further than the perpetrators of this heinous act for "fundamentalists". </p> <p> Like it or not, this country is multi-cultural and always has been. Islam is but another facet of our already mixed populace of Celts, Normans, Anglo-Saxons and other races and is no different.  It is about time we grew out of our ability to recognise difference and learned to concentrate on our similarities and common interests. Only then will this nonsense be ended.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ayaz</strong> replies:</em> Unfortunately life is not as simple as that.</p> <p>Never did I say that it was the muslim's fault for 'appearing muslim'. However, the harsh reality is that the drunkards targeted the muslim because that is what he looked like - a muslim. I am implying that these drunkards were probably hateful of muslims and maybe racist.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>MattD..</strong> replies:</em> Your point is well made. However, life should be that simple when it comes to this issue. These racists are insecure because they lack the mental capacity to understand people with diferent cultures. It is well known that people fear and lash out at things they do not understand.</p> <p>Often, their only point of reference is the media. In my opinion, the media have done a very poor job of educating these people with insights into Islam, the people who follow the faith and the rich culture surrounding it. Instead, they choose to lump any non-Christian religion and race into the "fundamentalist" category because it saves them having to think and learn. Often, these crusaders have no religious belief of their own, like myself.</p> <p>That these people of limited mental capacity follow the media blindly is unsurprising. We have lost most of our own culture, so it's easy to feel jealousy toward those who still maintain theirs. It's somewhat harder to take an objective look at one's self and recognise why.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Shreeves</strong> replies:</em> This is a tragic story. However it has little to do with voting. Going to the polling station is no different from going to the shops or going to work - unless you never leave your home,   in which case one is able to vote by post. I hope that the killers of your friend's son are apprehended and atone for their acts. Meanwhile - I suggest you go and vote - if you're not sure who to vote for, vote for change. </p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> Why? I don't agree with Labour and Conservatives. They both voted for curtailment of liberty. Lib Dem think increasing the tax is the solution to all problems. What party is left worthy of our votes then.  I would have supported Labour - but the new labour is all spin and talk, Lies and More Lies and do not even have the decency to say sorry to have got it all wrong in Iraq. To Blair, Bush is more important than the British people. To hell with him.</p>

	<p><em><strong>tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To original poster........This all started with your fear of voting because of possible attacks on you. Now your saying that your`e not going to vote because know one is worth voting for. Two completely seperate reasons.</p> <p>Iv`e got a feeling your original post was just an excuse. If so, a pretty sad one at that. Make your mind up as to why your`e not voting.</p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> tiger43: I know it would be difficult for you to understand it. You are not in our situation. Look at it this way: Why would we risk our life when none of the major parties are worthy of our vote. No, I am not trying to find excuse not to vote - I have always voted since 1981. But, at this election, I would not. Risks are not worth it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To poster (again)....So you have two reasons for not voting. Either you will get murdered in your valiant attempt to vote and the other is that know one is worth the vote.</p> <p>In the first, your`e not going to get attacked when you visit the poling booth and in the second, just vote. Its your right. My father didn`t fight in the last war so you and anyone else decides its just not worth the bother. You tell my father that! and I know exactly what he`d say to you. And I doubt whether it would be printable.</p>

	<p><em><strong>jay</strong> replies:</em> Tiger43: what to say of your views, you are entitled to those. And I have my view too. Any body who has 'unprintable' views is not worth to talk to. For your inforamtion, at last election 41% of the population did not bother to vote and this time it may be even higher. So you and your father could go on and let them have your peace of mind. Note however, you may get some back too.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To Jay.... Your`e just typical of the ungrateful generation in this country. You like nothing more than to complain on just about everything here. Going back to my father, its quite likely he wouldn`t waste his breath on a bunch of people that has such a low esteem of this country.</p> <p>If you find it such a burden living in one of the most succesful countries in the world then it just goes to show how bloody ungrateful you all are.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Jay</strong> replies:</em> Tiger43; even more of your touchy nerves showing up. I am not the original poster but I take exception to your comments (or your father's unprintable ones) about people deciding not to vote - 41% at the last election - more than the votes secured by any one party. The more you respond, more your personality comes out in the open. However, I am amused by your assuming that I am a non-white voter threatened by you 'whites'. Funny, quite funny. The biscuit goes to you. Good bye.</p>
