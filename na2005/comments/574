	<dd><p>not voting presents the only real alternative.  This country has been avoiding the consequences of democracy for years and the actual consequences have been the radical and destructive revolution of the thatcher years based on a popular vote of around 42% and now this government denying its own constituents to bring in equally unrepresentative and socially divisive initiatives.  If we cannot have represntative democacy, and it seems  increasingly unlikely in a media spun world fuelled by established political interests, then the debate must be widened by a voters strike.  What possible legitimacy can be claimed for a government based on a turnout of 12%? </p>

	<p><em><strong>azad</strong> replies:</em> While I understand and also agree with the motive and desired outcome of not voting, I disagree that the final result will translate to the  intended outcome.</p> <p>Basically, no one in position of power cares if you abstain, your position is neutral if you do not vote, and the message you are trying to send will be ignored and the winner will take it all.</p> <p>If they win, you loose, and unless you vote them out, others will foolishly vote them in.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> You cannot vote people out... You can only vote other people in. If you don't like any of the options available, then you're merely voting for whomever you dislike the least. There is no such thing as "voting out".</p>
