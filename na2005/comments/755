	<dd><p>I believe the UK politics system is unfair, the first past the post system just doesn't give a fair representation of people's views! I would prefer to live in a place with a proportional representation system, which of course the Lib Dems advocate (or used to!)  But they wont get my vote as I don't believe they can run a country. So I dont know who to vote for, we need a [ ] none of the above box on voting papers!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Bri</strong> replies:</em> I think it has been mentioned before (apologies for misquoting anyone); that not voting at all reflects a view that you cannot find a party that most suits you and therefore shows vote of "none of the above". Feel free to correct me if this is wrong or i have misinterpreted this.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jeffrey</strong> replies:</em> I'd advise you to spoil your ballot then.  These will be counted.</p> <p>I don't believe Lib Dems can run the country either, but since they won't win anyway I may as well show my support for them.  I simply cannot bring myself to vote Tory, even if it would stop a Labour candidate.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Fairy</strong> replies:</em> By NOT voting you are simply letting people think that you do not care. As Jeffrey says - spoil your ballot. PLEASE PLEASE VOTE. I am fed up with politicians thinking that the masses don't care how their country is being run - meaning they think they can walk all over society! Spoil your ballot and let them know that you do care - you are just annoyed.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> The lib dems may not stand much chance of gaining power to form a government but it is not only governments who introduce bills to parliament there is also at least one other way which is a private members bill. </p> <p>so if you vote for the lib dems thus getting more lib dems into parliamentary seats then petition them for raising the issue of unfair voting there is a better chance a private members bill could be introduced and, with a higher number of liberal mps and support from liberal minded mps (taking into account the coservatives need the pr system now as much as lib dems especially considering results from scotland) there is improved chances of finally getting a democratic voting system.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
