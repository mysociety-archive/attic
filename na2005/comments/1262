	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> Of course they're liars.  For a start they hope that most people die in one of their cesspit hospitals before they have the temerity to claim their pensions which are already earmarked for the millions of immigrants who are destined to "enrich" us in years to come.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Oh come on, it's not down to immigrants. It's the people who are here already that are the problem. Most legal immigrants are an asset (for instance, half of NHS doctors, or whatever it is - lots, anyway). We have an aging population and a huge number of people out of work due to "illness" and other less legitimate reasons. This is bound to put a strain on the nations economy. In a few years time, there will be more people not working than working in the UK. That is a big economic problem. This is a big deal that needs some real thinking. Bribing them, Brown style, is clearly not a solution.</p> <p>It is tricky. Pensioners who have worked hard all their lives should be able to maintain a better standard of living and provide more for their families than those who have not worked. But with the coffers so low, everyone ends up scraping the barrel and a lifetime of slogging away seems like a waste of time. A lot of people were sold on the idea of care from "cradle to grave" - it does seem that was an unrealistic promise.</p>

	<p><em><strong>G Holt</strong> replies:</em> While I entirely accept that there is a case for the review of pensions for those in Britain, the pensioners in Austrakia, Canada and South Africa are beig cheated by their annual increases being frozen, a terrible discrimination that cannot be be morally justified.G Holt</p>

	<p><em><strong>Bernard Wright</strong> replies:</em> Write your response..Of course it is morally wrong not to increase all pensions.As to where you live has nothing to do with the pesion it'self<br />The State Pension in this country is only 16.75%of the national average wage ,but other EU countries have at least 50% of their national average wage.<br />Why the discrimination?.It is about time the house of commons was closed down as politicians are a waste of public money</p>
