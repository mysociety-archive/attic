	<p><em><strong>Paul</strong> replies:</em> Spoiling your ballot is a waste of time. Do people realise that ALL votes, including defaced ones, are counted as part of the turnout. So it looks as if you're endorsing the election even if you spoil your ballot. Secondly, spoiled votes are never announced or reported. It took three years for researchers to establish the spoiled votes total in the 2001 election. So spoiling your vote is an act of self-indulgence. Better to stay away altogether on May 5 and then do something about changing the political system.</p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> although i understand the sentiment of the above post this course of action will change nothing. the electoral system is designed to return the same parties to power. nobody will be looking at the protest on your ballot paper. what must change is the mindset of the electorate....who continually vote for the big three. people must wake up to what is happening behind the headlines of the tabloids.the media is a smokescreen hiding the real political agendas of the big three. these agendas are the same! please vote, but vote for anybody but the con/lab/lib deception.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Original Poster</strong> replies:</em> Paul, if that's your philosophy why not campaign for a general boycott of the election?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Paul</strong> replies:</em> That is exactly what I am doing! Me and supporters of a book I co-authored are out there tonight urging people to withhold their vote and instead build a movement that fights for a fundamental change. You can find out more about our campaign at http://www.aworldtowin.net<br />It's about changing the negative of non-voting into a positive force for change. It's a tough job - but There Is No Alternative (to borrow a phrase used to justify the status quo)<br />Paul</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
