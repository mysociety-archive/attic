	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> Fraid your logic is flawed.</p> <p>The membership i.e. the individual MP's can vote against the leader and frequently do - student top up fees being one such example, where several Labour MP's voted with the opposition against the Government (which still won the vote albeit with a narrow majority).</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> Your logic is still flawed.</p> <p>The leader alone cannot override the decisions of the membership.</p> <p>It requires the leadership + the appropriate number of MP's.</p> <p>If the Labour Party had decided not to institute top up fees, but Tony Blair had decided he wanted to, it would have required him to gain enough support from Labour MP's + opposition MP's in order to enact his desires.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> Then what is the point of having a leader? If he does your bidding, then he isn't a leader. Leaders are chosen by the membership (in the case of Labour, the affiliated trade unions too), not just MPs and in some cases the party in question may have no MPs. Can anyone tell me what a political party leader's official position is (i.e. his terms of reference)?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> The leader is there to lead the party.</p> <p>It's like the captain of a ship. He controls the ship, but still needs the support of the crew.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> If you know what you want and know how to get it, why do you need leaders? OK, so a captain has certain skills that the crew do not, and he does have a *legal* position. <br />I would still like to know what the terms of reference of a political leader are.</p>
