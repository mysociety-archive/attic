	<p><em><strong>Gill Swanson</strong> replies:</em> True.  Why are we always being told it's either higher taxes or drastic spending cuts, when governments aren't prepared to provide us with a stable money supply?  Only notes and coins are supplied as interest-free credit, and as electronic money has taken over, during the past fifty years or so, this has rapidly fallen as a proportion of our total money stock, to be replaced by more and more bank "credit.  By 1997, the government was relying on ordinary people and businesses to go into debt,through mortgages and other loans, to provide 97% of the money in circulation. If governments were prepared to create and spend into the economy the same 41% of the total money supply as they did in 1948, rather than the measly 3% they fob us off with now, it would go at least some way to easing present levels of private and commercial debt, and to resolving the tax v spend issue.  Why should we have to go into debt for the privilege of exchanging goods and services with each other?  And why has no main party put money reform at the top of of their manifesto list, when the insane insistence in creating our currency as an interest-bearing debt to the banks is at the root of so many problems?

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
