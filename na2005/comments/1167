	<dt>FROZEN PENSION DISCRIMINATION</dt>
	<dd><p>I am not registered as a voter having lived in Australia for the past 48 years. If I did have a vote it would be one of "NO CONFIDENCE" due to the recalcitrant attitude of successive Governments on the 'freezing' of state age pensions both here and in other 'old' commonwealth countries such as Canada and Sth.Africa. This imposition is unjust, immoral, and out-and-out discrimination against it's expatriate citizens!!</p>

	<p><em><strong>G. Holt</strong> replies:</em> I entirely agree. My pensioin has been frozen for years, simply because I ceased living in Spain and moved to Australia. As we are non- residents our efforts to get justice are ignored.  I just hope that some UK voters who read about  the injustice we suffer will help us by sending a brief letter or email of complaint to their MP.  That would really help us. Do please take the trouble!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Lily Ranson</strong> replies:</em> My Husband and I emigrated to Canada from England in 1957. As my husband was the 43 he decided that we should pay his contributions every year as an insurance as he was ten years older than me.He always thought that it would cover me for a Widows pension should anything happen to him. In those days we scraped the bottom of the barrel to send the money each year as in our early years money was tight.He served in the Royal Air Force through the battle of Britain and was totally disappointed when at retirement age his pension was frozen. Sadly he passed away last September at the age of 90. I now get 38 pounds per week instead of 82 pounds per week as a widow even though he was fully paid up to get a full pension. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Banjo</strong> replies:</em> I accept the arguments about frozen pensions being unfair, but I think that it is only right and proper to deny a vote to ex-pats.</p> <p>Why should some one who has buggered off abroad be allowed to decide the fate of those who remain ?</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Derrick</strong> replies:</em> Because the rules say I can.<br />But you make it sound as though we are a bunch of "prolies", living it up in sunny climes.Why shouldn't we vote? Most of us fought for the right to do so!</p> <p>Perth Western Australia</p>

	<p><em><strong>Alec</strong> replies:</em> In my initial comment on 'Frozen' pension discrimination, I used the term'if I did have to vote' NOT that I wanted to vote! All that expatriate pensioners are seeking, is parity with their fellow pensioners who live in counties such as the USA, Bermuda, Barbados, Jamaica, Israel, Malta, The Philippines, and Turkey, etc., not to mention the European Economic Area (EEA)countries of Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark with some of these our enemies in WW2.!!!  If that's not discrimination and in the face of all logic, I don't know what is.!!</p>
