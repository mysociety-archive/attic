	<p><em><strong>Mike Dimmick</strong> replies:</em> Polling stations are open between 7am and 10pm on polling day. You should be able to get to your polling station either before or after your exams - probably after, if my experience is accurate. It only takes about five minutes.</p> <p>You still have time to apply for a postal or proxy vote.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Van Gasten</strong> replies:</em> Closing date for application to vote postally in this election is April 26th, and, as Mike says, the polls are open well on either side of any conceivable exam times. This is an effort worth making, kids!</p>

	<p><em><strong>tiger43</strong> replies:</em> Oh dear, I might miss my exams, what shall I do? Thats right, you make sure you don`t miss your exams, to hell with the country`s future, if there is one. Don`t be so lame. Get off your fat student arse and vote!!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> There's nothing wrong with the student loan system. It's very reasonable. You get plenty of money to live on, you're only in trouble if you waste your money on booze (well, OK, if you have rich parents who won't support you or insist upon going to university somewhere that has very high rental prices, it could be a bit tight, so you might have to get a job in the ample holidays).  And I am a recent graduate, BTW. </p> <p>It's good to hear from a student who is taking his / her course so seriously.  It takes longer than just the time to go to the ballet box - you do have to figure out who to vote for. I'm sure plenty of people have spent many hours looking into the choices. You need to keep a clear head for your finals.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Hamish</strong> replies:</em> I'm afraid I have to break it to you: the reason you're not voting *is* apathy. You could easily make it to a polling station, or get a postal or proxy vote, but you don't care enough to do so. If it weren't your finals, it would probably be a football match, or a trip to the shops, or whatever. There's always something more important to do than vote; it's not like your vote is going to make a difference anyway, is it? You are pretty much the textbook example of apathetic.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> Hamish, feeling like your vote will not make a difference (and therefore placing other activities at a higher priority) is not apathy, lack of interest, lack of concern or indifference.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> B*ll*x - Apathy IS Lazy!!!</p> <p>And Gavin - at last someone who agrees with me.  Yes - the student loan system is very reasonable! (Myself also being a recent graduate).</p>

	<p><em><strong>Julie</strong> replies:</em> I have to say this is pure laziness and short-sightedness on a grand scale. My finals start next week and i've been revising for a week or two already but nothing could keep me away from the polling booth on thursday. As soon as you have your first graduate job your degree grade will become meaningless, if its all that important anyway. </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
