	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Why not have raise some money for them? £500 may take a while to raise, especially as I imagine the more wealthy residents of the area would not vote Green (most people like &gt;1 policy), but it should be possible.</p> <p>Unless, of course, there is no local support for them - in which case, it's tough luck - that's democracy.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Kevin Ward</strong> replies:</em> This is actually the first genuine reason I have encountered on this site for not casting a vote! Still you should write to whoever does win your seat and raise this issue with them. I'm sure you are not alone in your frustration. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Mattus</strong> replies:</em> If the £500 fee was abolished then we would have all forms of fake 'politicians' entering elections because they feel like it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>jb</strong> replies:</em> I find it hard to believe that they can't raise £500??<br />surely there are 20 like minded people Ipswich who can afford to chuck in £25 each !!!!</p> <p>Or has the North / South divide really got that bad?</p>

	<p><em><strong>David</strong> replies:</em> Probably a tacit admission that they wouldn't win - but that's more a reflection of the diabolical electoral system than anything else. Parties with minority support spread thinly across the country have no chance of winning a seat; if we introduced proportional representation we'd instantly have at least five Green MPs. (And possibly a BNP member or two, but the Tories are becoming so extremist that they should steal those votes.)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Luther Blissett</strong> replies:</em> Gavin trying being informed about things first before talking utter cock-nonsense; actually read the Greens manifesto, for example.  More policies that the party members/activist/supporters actually believe in than you've had intelligent thoughts.  And more policies than the one policy of  "whatever will give me power" followed by certain parties.</p> <p>Policies which are generally engineered towards the greater good, I might add.</p> <p></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
