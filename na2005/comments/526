I have been looking into the spoiled paper is 'none of the above'
Googling around showed lots of people believe this but it is not true.
There is a good link on the bbc to how the count is done

	<dd><p>spoiled paper is NOT 'none of the above'<br />I have been looking into the spoiled paper is 'none of the above'<br />Googling around showed lots of people believe this but it is not true.<br />There is a good link on the bbc to how the count is done<br />(http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/voting_system/newsid_1171000/1171887.stm)</p> <p>I then wrote to my MP for clarification.</p> <p>I asked the following question</p> <p>"I have been told that spoiled ballot papers are counted and act as a<br />vote for 'none of the above' whereas not voting is effectively 'any of<br />the above'. If enough spoiled papers were submitted, the election<br />would have to be re-run.</p> <p>Is this true?"</p> <p>The reply came:</p> <p>"The returning officer at our election details the number of votes cast <br />for each candidate and the number of papers rejected, both in total and <br />in each of the categories for rejection.</p> <p>A ballot paper can be rejected for the following reasons - voting for <br />more than one candidate, writing or a mark by which the voter could be <br />identified, unmarked or void for uncertainty. There is no seperate <br />category for spoilt ballots and thus the scenario you propose could not happen"</p> <p>Hence spoiling your paper is the same as not voting (except that it wastes the counters time).<br />The net result is not voting or spoinling your paper actually means 'Any of the above'</p> <p>Vote for the party closest to your views rather than the party you think will win unless you really feel that any of them are good enough to represent you.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris</strong> replies:</em> I don't think that there's ever been an election in which the number of spoiled ballots exceeded the number cast for the winning candidate. While, as you say, there would be no automatic byelection in such a case, the MP would probably be a national laughing stock and, hopefully, too chastened to do anything foolish.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andrew</strong> replies:</em> After the last election I wondered about this and sent an email off to the electoral commission. They replied saying that spoiled ballot papers are not counted towards turnout.</p> <p>So unless you have someone waiting at every count with a calculator in hand to work out the real turnout, spoiling your ballot is a waste of time. </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
