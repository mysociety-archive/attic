	<dd><p>I AM voting, but i want to say that everyone here will be the first to complain when the government they don't want gets in - if you don't vote, you lose your right to complain; it's as simple as that.  Also, anyone who says that the Conservatives are living in the past obviously don't realise that they are actually a much more liberal party than they are given credit for - they have women and homosexuals involved in their politics just like the other parties! Now, change your mind and  get voting!</p>

	<p><em><strong>James Brown</strong> replies:</em> You seem to be missing the point here. </p> <p>How is voting for someone complaining? </p> <p>'You've done a crap job, but well done and here's my vote?'</p> <p>It just doesn't wash any longer. I look forward to this evening when the turn-out is known and we'll find out even more people than last time agree with me, and even less people agree with your starry eyed enthusiasm for our flawed political system.</p> <p>If you really thing voting for someone will change that system, best of luck to you, because it never has before.</p>

	<p><em><strong>MG</strong> replies:</em> James,</p> <p>I'm not sure that I understand your thread.  Are you pro-voting?</p> <p>The key issue here is that casting a vote for a party that you don't agree with is not a complaint, but then again neither is apathy.  If one truly does not agree with any of the parties then spoiling your paper sends a far stronger message.  You are actively telling the parties that you do not want any of them.</p> <p>As it stands of the 41% that did not vote last time round it is impossible to say how many just couldn't be bothered or how many actively didn't vote because there was nothing they felt they wanted to vote for. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Tog</strong> replies:</em> And how will you ensure that a spoiled paper isn't just recorded as an error? Who makes the decision and to what criteria?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Malc</strong> replies:</em> So, a site dedicated to those who will not vote gets hijacked by a smug voter. Well, what a surprise. If you feel that one of the major parties represents you, then your voice, i.e. vote, can be registered today. This site is meant to be for those whose voices CANNOT be registered. If you can't listen nicely, go play somewhere else.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anto</strong> replies:</em> Malc, what do mean your voice cannot be registered. You're never going to find a candidate who represents your exact views on every single subject.  You have to pick the candidate whose views are closest to yours and at least get some representation instead of none.  If you want the perfect candidate, why don't you stand for election yourself?</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> "everyone here will be the first to complain when the government they don't want gets in"<br />Yes, correct; no matter which party forms a government, "everyone here" will complain.  This is because "everyone here" doesn't like ANY of the parties nor the present system.</p> <p>" - if you don't vote, you lose your right to complain; it's as simple as that"</p> <p>Not at all!  That makes no sense whatsoever.  You seem to be saying  that you have the right to complain if your vote helps a party win (or lose)... but you feel that people have no right to complain (to have a voice) about the electoral system, party politics, to the point where they -- not from apathy -- but from a strong moral sense, choose deliberately not to vote as a method of complaint.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Peter</strong> replies:</em> So if none of the parties represented in the election had your views why did you not think to stand as a local candidate?<br />If there was more independant candidates who actually believed in something maybe some of the non-voters here might have someone to vote for!</p>
