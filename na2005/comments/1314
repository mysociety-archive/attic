	<p><em><strong>Ben Leslie</strong> replies:</em> In 1987, Lewisham West was won by the Tories, and was considered a moderately safe seat before that. If too many people take your view, they could get back in again. Then you will have to ask whether you really wouldn't rather have had most of the good things Labour has done, or are happy to see the Tories dismantle it all. This assumes you are broadly left-wing, of course. Otherwise...</p> <p>Now Lewisham Deptford, where I live, really is safe - 65% Labour share in 2001. But I'll still be voting - you can't be too sure...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> I think the people of Lewisham West should fight for there freedom and become a state seperate from the UK. I beleive that the new nation of Lewisham West would do a lot better economically and socially with its own government and national football team from Britain. Lewisham West would probanly give the England team a good run for its money as well. And its own army would no doubt be strong enough to shake its fist at the USA.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Ah, what's so bad about the Tories? At least they're honest abot their political stance (they don't pretend to be socialists) and their leader isn't quite so publicity hungry (keep grinning, Tony).</p>

	<p><em><strong>Betty Swallocks</strong> replies:</em> Ben Leslie - exactly what good things have Labour done?  66 tax rises since 1997, dirty hospitals where you're more likely to die of MRSA than what you were admitted with, failing schools - pupils getting 44% just for spelling their names right at the top of the paper, 5 wars started, the last Iraq pushed through the basis of a lie, tons of bureaucracy created to keep Blair's babes in cushy posts.  Oh and before you mention falling unemployment - they just found a different way to count it, the same trick they pull everytime they're failing to hit a target.  Things can only get better?  Only if New Labour all drop off the planet on 5 May </p>

	<p><em><strong>Ben Leslie</strong> replies:</em> Betty Swallocks asks me what good Labour have done: The reduction in child poverty on its own would be enough for me - something the tories would never have done in a million years. I'm sure the 66 tax rises are wrong, but taxes have risen to pay for things like this, and a good thing too.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy</strong> replies:</em> It strikes me that all of you have abandoned your objectivity and nailed your colors to the mast - and THAT is the problem : thinking for ones self. Politicians (all) are masters at the distortion-of-truth-by-association trick and it saddens me how many people fall for it and are prepared to argue with each other based on spin fed to them by the various parties - and not their own thoughts..</p>

	<p><em><strong>Keith</strong> replies:</em> Betty Swallocks is a Spoonerism. However, the letters in her(?) name are the only thing she has got back to front in her critique of Labour.</p> <p>Ever since Mr Bliar responded to a question by an NHS worker during the last (or maybe first) campaign - I realized he was as insincere and as dishonest as a politician can get (and that is saying something). How 40% of the partici[atory electorate can vote for Labour defies logic and many other things besides. Having said that, maybe it is just a reflection of how much the Tories have lost the plot. Like - "Oh the Conservatives still havn't twigged they are meant to be serving the people rather than themselves - better vote Labour 'til they twig."  A pretty good reason for apathy to me.</p>
