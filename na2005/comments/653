	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Apathy <br />n.<br />1. Lack of interest or concern, especially regarding matters of general importance or appeal; indifference.<br />2. Lack of emotion or feeling; impassiveness.</p> <p>(Dictionary.com)</p> <p>Anyone who has a reason - whether it is a good reason or not - to not vote is not apathetic. These people ARE interested, but do not feel that voting will do anything for them or feel that not voting makes more of a statement. If you think the statements here generally show a "lack of interest or concern" or a "lack of emotion", you may need to read a few more examples.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy</strong> replies:</em> Well said Gavin, totally agree with that.  The people who have entered comments on this site, such as myself, are not voting for a reason, not because we are indifferent.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Don't wanna - don't have to, and you can't make me...! </p> <p>Why is it that idiots like Andrew come on here and say things like that? I mean, to my way of thinking (and who is to say who is wrong and who is right?!) the people who are in the wrong aren't the ones who AREN'T voting but the ones who ARE. If enough people didn't vote then there'd be no choice but to change the electoral system. However all the sheep who spout the same rubbish about how we SHOULD vote, or we HAVE to for one reason or another; they are the people who are perpetuating this undemocratic and obsolete system of voting.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
