	<dt>is it worth losing my citizenship for?</dt>
	<dd><p>even though i have been a british national for nearly 10 years, and this is my permanant home, i am still not ALLOWED to vote.  </p> <p>I am ELEGIBLE to become a UK citizen, BUT : I *could* go ahead and pay over £200 that i don't have, fill out the application form (which is apparantly what the £200 is needed for!), pledge allegiance to the queen in a public ceremony (which in and of itself i have no problem with doing), risk losing my original citizenship because i pledged my allegance to the queen in a PUBLIC ceremony (which i DO have a problem with doing), when voting is the ONLY legal thing that i can not do in this country with my current (and permanant) immagration status.</p> <p>is one vote that would probably be going anyway to the party that has won in my constituancy for at least the last 30 years, and losing my citizenship to my home country so that it becomes difficult to travel there, and spending money that i don't have to pay for a vote that probably wouldn't make any difference actually worth it??</p> <p>no, i don't think so either.</p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> thank you, lodjer, for respecting my decision not to become a british citizen at this time.</p> <p>i actually don't have a problem pledging allegiance to the queen, *or* to this country.  this is very much my home now, and contrary to the conclusion that 'def' inaccurately jumped to, i love it here and don't think at all that it is "so bad".</p> <p>it's losing my own citizenship (my country does not recognize duel citizens) and paying for the vote (i can't believe that there is between £200 and £300 worth of administration to pay for in processing one appication) that i have a problem with.  </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
