	<p><em><strong>Philip Ashton</strong> replies:</em> would the writer of this comment vote to return saddam hussein to power? also the situation in iran is significantly different to the situation that existed in iraq before the war. the government in iran was formed after a revolution of the general populace against a corrupt and oppressive western backed monarchy. now iran is one of the most liberal countries in the middle east, women can divorce, work and drive. the government in tehran is supported by the general population. saddam was truly supported by only a few diehards. they will never invade iran.</p>

	<p><em><strong>R.Lafferty</strong> replies:</em> One of the reasons people don't vote is because politicians lie. A lot.<br />So please remember that we DID NOT invade Iraq because Saddam was a bad person. The reason given at the time was WMD. And force against Iran has not been ruled out. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Nerys Jones</strong> replies:</em> I therefore suggest that Philip Ashton reads the manifestos of some of the other political parties and votes for one of them - easy solution!</p>

	<p><em><strong>S. Morris</strong> replies:</em> Im afraid, Philip that you are reverting to liberal type. The overwhelming attitude of many educated Iranians who are forced to endure a corrupt islamic government is a desire to be free to enjoy a secular lifestyle. And by a US-UK invasion if that is the only option. </p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> No, I wouldn't vote to return Saddam Hussein to power. I would say that was a typically disingenious reply but it is obvious from the reply itself that you don't have the wit to be disingenious. </p> <p>And if you think that "it will never happen" all I can say is "wait and see". The US has had special forces on the ground in Iran for some time now; and surely no even partially objective adult can have failed to notice the changing language by the government re: Iran.</p> <p>No-one said that we/the US/whoever would invade Iran because the government there are bad eggs. For you to assume that would have to be the case suggests to me that you need to do some serious reading before opening your mouth in public again. Look at Iraq. As R. Lafferty says above, it wasn't because Saddam was a bad person - although when backed into a corner because of his lies Tony B.Liar DID try to suggest this was the case. Well all I can say is, if you believe that kind of politico-bullshit, more fool you!! And God help us all if many people think the same as you do...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> The apologists for Tony Blair always fall back onto the <em>would you rather Sadam was still in power ?</em> line in order to justify the war in Iraq.</p> <p>I am glad to see the back of Sadam, but I am not pleased about being misled and lied to in order to achieve that aim.</p> <p>No doubt if Sadam was pro-Western, in the same way as Saudia Arabia's dictators are, then no invasion would have taken place, no matter how many Kurds he gassed.</p> <p>The US has the same policy the world over. Dictatorships are only evil when they are not pro-US in their stance. <br /></p>
