	<dd><p>There is no representitive of my views.. I would vote for BNP, as i see the forced multiculturalism upon the indigenous britons as immoral and unnatural. The British never had a say in the matter, a vote or anything, yet we are forced to accept it, otherwise we are labelled under the broad and varied word "racism", just for wanting to maintain our culture. In the short term the BNP won't gain power on a mass scale but the forced tolerance by the Labour government of immigrants and non-whites only breeds intolerance.. which will inevitably lead to the BNP becoming more and more prominent. People may accuse BNP supporters of Racism but they are just a product of Multi-culturalism and liberalism. The very fact that Native Britains will be a minority by 2050 is a good enough reason alone to support the BNP as they are the only party who protects the needs of the Indigenous...in stark contrast to the Central parties whom cater toward the ethnic population. Thankyou.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> "Native Britains" - who're they, then? I have a certain amount of foreign blood, so there are people from "ethnic minorities" who are, arguably "more British" than me, I suppose. It just depends how far back you go. Maintaining a culture is one thing, but as soon as you start talking about "non-whites", you're clouding the issue, to say the least. You can be just as non-British and still be white. And there are plenty of very British non-whites.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Alison</strong> replies:</em> You can complicate the issue if you want, but the term native briton is used by many, to describe those of British or European descent before the influx of multiculturalism! The fact is, i don't want Britain to head in the direction it is going toward - which began with the Forced multiculturalism and has now spread to such laws which prohibit free speech! I am proud of our culture, and peoples and the very threat from mass immigration and ethnic populus means i would be voting BNP if possible.. Not because i am racist - just because we're losing our idendity and rights. Alot of censorship in the media for example. I would've never been against immigration as long as it was limited and would never threaten the existing way of life. my area for example is a majoritly muslim one, socially it feels undesireable and i often feel unwelcome in my own area. And this has brought Mosques and its hard to identify with my surroundings as a Brit. Overall i just don't like where we are leaning toward and would like Britain to return to if possible a britain for the British, an example of this is Japan and how well they treat their people and way of life. Thankyou.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rob Read</strong> replies:</em> To be honest the idea of democracy come from the word Demos meaning "a single people".</p> <p>Multi-Culturalism obviously mixes peoples and can be considered an attack on democracy.</p> <p>This is why controls on immigration are important otherwise high levels of immigration will destroy the demos thus destroying governance of the UK.</p> <p>Without a feeling of demos, democracy is just disguised mob rule.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jamie</strong> replies:</em> How do people treat each other in Japan, Alison?  Do you actually know anything about it?  Japanese people are incredibly pressured.  Japan is about 30 years behind us socially - women give up careers when they are married so they can cook and clean for a husband who stays out drinking all night because he's so stressed out over his job.  A generalisation to be sure, but pretty accurate.  Happy families it is not.</p> <p>99.5% of people here are Japanese.  That means everyone else is an outsider.  In this way, the Japanese are institutionally racist.  If you don't want to be racist, you don't want to be like Japan.  But you are racist anyway, so it doesn't matter.  "A Britain for the British"  - don't make me laugh.  Are you talking about the Celts, Gauls, Vandals, Angles, Saxons or Vikings?  How about Irish and Scottish people - do they offend you too?  I bet they don't.  They have a lot of individual culture that isn't English.  Face it, you're scared of these people because they're Asian and they go to mosques and you don't understand them.  That makes you racist.</p> <p>And by forced multiculturalism I take it you mean slavery and the British Empire?  That is, after all how many "non-natives" as you call them, came to be here.  So, are you proud of that, particularly, or not?</p> <p>Maybe you could try interacting with people, instead of being scared by them?  To be sure there are bad Asian people, but don't forget that there are lots of bad white people too.  The BNP must be loving this - playing on people's fears and insecurities for their own power.  Open your eyes, use your brain, people are different, get over it.  Embrace it, celebrate it and enjoy the diversity that we have which makes our country so great.</p>

	<p><em><strong>alison</strong> replies:</em> Jamie, i respect what you have written and can see your point - bu this isn't i can assure you a race attack..its actually to save our race. It sounds Naziesque but it truly isn't, like every race and sub-race would do for their own.. and that includes all the ethnic minorities in the UK. Now.. if you don't think the "Ethnic" british are under threat fo existence then look at figures given out by various institutions that state , not just in Britain, but in Holland, France etc that the Whites will be a  minority by 2050 and onwards. Now you may say the British is a free for all blah blah blah but when i say the British indigenous it does consist of the Romans.Normans/Saxons/celts and the Vikings. They may be different but theyre all very closely related and they have intermingled over centuries where Britain had made it's own people. I don't want to be 75 and see that my country has totally changed and lost it's true family values at the expense of liberlaism/capitalism and multiculturalism. There is no diversity in multi culturalism -  the whole theroy is that we will all blend intogether thus becoming one big melting pot.. wheres the diversity in that - i want to live my culture and see it continue. I dont dislike other cultures but i dont enjoy them impinging on that of my own. Now you people love to question words to make the issue complex and hazey.. liek what do you mean "yours", what do you mean "indigenous"... its clear enough what we mean...I am proud of our history, what our ancestors have fought for centuries to carve out this country for us -  just for it to be treated as a Shelter! I hope you can respect that this is how i feel and despite you thinking i am brainwashed - i have actually made these opinions for myself, its you people who are brainwashed who are forcefed your moral opinions on liberalism, multiculturalism etc by the media and other sources. You have to look deeper and see it for what it is. And if you want all the races and cultures to live happily side by side in britain then you should want a halt to immigration as if the tide continues then there will only be more racial tensions. <br />And never in History has diferent peoples been brought to a foreign area and made to live next to and with the locals. This is unnatural - Multiculturalism was never voted on by the people.. it was forced and its gone into extremes.. It was a social experiment for capitalism(cheap labour) - not a moral one which you all believe.. i suggest you take a hard look at the facts and realise what the situation is and using the word "racist" for people who care for their people is ridiculous.. the word racism is patheric as its use has been twisted  over the years..ie. to say you only wanted a white boyfriend would be racist" - when its your decision, why should you be forcedto want an ethnic just because they live here??? And another example of racism is an accurate one where you may say something negative about a race like a trait! That lats one is racism not the one before - but they are both commonly used as a kind of modern day "witch hunt" to denounce somebody in an argument. The word racist is a no starter. Its meaning is used in the wrong context more so. </p>

	<p><em><strong>William</strong> replies:</em> I agree with Alison that there was and is no concensus in Britain for embracing  multi-culturalism.<br />And yes by 'multi-culturalism' I specifically mean peoples from the Asian sub continent, Africa, Middle East.</p> <p>I think that if it were put to a referendum most people would be against mass Immigration from these areas.</p> <p>There is a mass disquiet in the 'White" population at the rapid and 'engineered' changes to British society. If they speak up about their genuine concerns they are told they are racist.</p> <p>I don't think it is racist - it is just a desire to have a continuity of British culture and society.<br />Yes of course there has been huge influences from invaders over the milenium (and beyond).</p> <p>The difference is that their influence was not developed through them claiming asylum (falsely).</p> <p> <br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>alison</strong> replies:</em> Well said William.. you made it alot clearer than i did. the fact si i know the people on here wont understand.. but this is our vote and we dont understand your vote likewise.. there is no happy medium for us both. <br />I also think that other than BNP supporters, the most understanding people i have spoken to in the real world have been ethnic on this issue. Those are the people i respect as they can see things objectively without using the words racism. Thankyou. Im off now from this debate. </p>

	<p><em><strong>raymond</strong> replies:</em> William: true, invaders do not have to claim asylum, even falsely. It is the captureds who have to save their lives. So the immigrants should capture us and then multiculturism would be all right - as long as they asylum is not involved.</p>

	<p><em><strong>William</strong> replies:</em> raymond - you have made no attempt to answer the genuine condern that most white British people feel about the type of mass immagration they are being subjected to.</p> <p>In my (and many peoples) experience multi-culturism means in practice 'villages' of people from the indian subcontinent leading seperate lives in seperate communities. With little or no meaningful contact with the 'white' population.</p> <p>Indeed racism exists in Britain - and it is very ugly. What is not generaly accepted is that racism isn't only a 'white' problem. It is an aspect of 'brown' and 'black' communities as well.</p> <p>As to your confused point about 'captureds' (sic) - I can't really follow it.</p> <p>Could you make the point again please.</p>

	<p><em><strong>WM</strong> replies:</em> I s it wrong to put the British way of life and Britain before multiculturalism ? I am not sure that there is an enforced policy of multiculturalism, but  the shrinking world has accelerated its onslaught. I would like the British government to apply the brakes..</p> <p>The funny thing is, the people who advocate multiculturalism say it brings diversity and variety into society. Maybe at first, but eventually the world will become one huge uniform shade of dull boring grey. To keep the world interesting surely its obvious that everyone should  protect their identity and embrace their indigenous cultures.   The British government should be protecting ours. Controlled immigration is one aspect, but so many other things need to be addressed.</p> <p> The thing is, with the decline in respect and social conscience it is getting very difficult to remain proudly British. This may be due (in part) to a loss of identity. That is another issue..</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Edward James</strong> replies:</em> Alison writes: 'I don't want to....see that my country has totally changed and lost it's true family values at the expense of.....multiculturalism'.</p> <p>Family Values?  How absolutely laughable.  And what kind of family values does British society promote exactly?  Ever increasing divorce rates, the highest rate of single teenage mums and once children have reached adulthood, no sense of responsibility for the other from both parts.  As an example, I think you will find that in Asia, care homes are relatively non-existent and divorce rates are much lower, indicating a greater sense of reponsibility for so called 'family-values'.  In fact, I think the British could learn a lot from them.</p> <p>And as for Will's comment:'You might protest that there is an underlying core of our "Britishness" that persists throughout the history of our nation (language, industry, tea-drinking, cricket etc)'.</p> <p>Tea drinking?  Cricket?  Again, HUGELY laughable.  Hello?  Could someone please tell me where these activities originated.  Umm, could it possibly be Asia?</p>

	<p><em><strong>alison</strong> replies:</em> Well the examples you provided Edward James i coincide with Liberlaism.. the degenaration of our peoples. As we see with crime, youth out fo control, Teenage parenting and the sort! It's all due to the lack of control and discipline. i get extremely fed up with you people so intent on handing our country away. I suggset you get off your moral pedestal and take off your rose tinted specs and take a look at whats happening. Too many of you..ignorance is Bliss!<br />You may continue with your liberal rhetoric but i declare this discussion over.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Edward James</strong> replies:</em> Alison - you keep declaring this debate to be over!</p> <p>You still have not stated exactly what you mean by 'true family values'.  You are indeed entitled to your view point, but at least back it up with a reasoned argument and valid points.</p> <p>I am a white, middle-class, public-school educated male and have often been accused of being the epitomy of 'Britishness'.  However, we British ourselves are to blame for the decline in what we once held dear to our hearts.  We have asians settling here, who are commited to preserving their culture and religion.  How do we try and preserve ours?  We don't as we aren't willing to give the same amount of commitment.  How many people would refer to themselves as Christians nowadays?  Not many, yet we are all too willing to celebrate every Christian festival such as Christmas and Easter.  These factors, though seemingly unrelated, are closely bound together.  Times and society is changing, you just have to live with it.  We have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>

	<p><em><strong>alison</strong> replies:</em> Edward James.. i suggest you do some research into hat amkes a culture and its internal governing influences which may go unseen. You are not familiar with how we are actually being run! You views are those that are forcefed to you by the media and i would love to see you think for yourself. I am proud to be British and you have to realise the society we live in is ignorant of this! Th "White guilt" is clear for everyone to see... its their to diminish national idendity and prde within ones self and race... leading to the introduction of multi culturalism for capitalist and ZOG interests. <br />You are severely mislead and all i want to do is push Britain to how it should be like before. Like i said the forced tolerance of a  multi cultural society is good enough reason to want an end to the social experiment. </p> <p>Like al liberals you seem to lack a core of dignity who dont care for their legacy to continue.. History proves that things never stay the same for long, and as we see, that Britain will either turn into a nationalist nation or will be pushed toward the "Brazil syndrome".. if you cant work out that then you needn't bother replying! Either way, you wont be happy at the end result Edward, i guarantee it..</p> <p>here is  alink i would like you to educate yourself on</p> <p>http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html</p> <p>thankyou.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Julie</strong> replies:</em> While Britain and other western nations continue to base their economic success on the exploitation of the third world then we have no right to complain about the number of immigrants who come to Britain to escape poverty or intimidation.  I would argue though that immigration is not handled well by the government - immigrants are ghettoised which can lead to them feeling excluded and thus uncommitted to the British political system, and also leads to a lot of understandable fear and insecurity from local 'indigineous' Brits. It doesn't matter what religion or colour you are as long as you are honest, compassionate and tolerant, surely better values to aspire to have as national characteristics than being white and morris dancing.</p>

	<p><em><strong>nico</strong> replies:</em> Does anyone want to list some British cultural traditions they think are being eroded I bet no one can list more that 5 credible ones - go on I DARE YOU.</p> <p>Other countries have very well defined cultural traditions, we really dont - its one of our defining charachteristics. We talk about the weather an inordinate amount and sometimes apologize un necessarily - we are also efficient queuers.</p> <p>bottom line I dont feel paticularly threatened by other cultures, there is just always something new to learn - about them and ourselves.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Samuel</strong> replies:</em> Alison, grow up and get real. You are truly ignorant and racist.  You cannot spell so obviousy uneducated to aswell. No wonder you are scared of "immigrants" most of them are probably more inteligent than you.</p> <p>By not voting you have no right whatsoever to criticise, put down others, or express such stupid opinions. </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Samuel</strong> replies:</em> So sorry, I was so angry at Alisons remarks that I did not check my own spelling or grammar. Many appologies before people come back and tell me that I too cannot spell, because I can.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Will</strong> replies:</em> I just wanted to express my exasperation with Edward James, whose views I do actually support. I just wish he had taken the time to read my earlier contribution more closely. If he had done so he would have seen that I was espousing the benefits of immigration-induced change. I was pointing out that those in favour of retaining so-called 'Britishness' should look beyond the cliches that have come to identify our culture. The sarcastic point he made in reply only served to reinforce my point. Please read more carefully, and resist the temptation to ridicule other contributors.</p>
