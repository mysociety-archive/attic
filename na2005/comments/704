	<dt> First time vote seeks Party to represnt views</dt>
	<dd><p>Because after visiting each major partys site in an attempt to come to a decision I've come to the conclusion that:</p> <p>1) Voting Lib-dem as a protest vote isn't worth the risk WHAT IF THEY ACTUALY GOT IN, here you go Charles have a country, 'Hum, Eh, Well actually I was only running as a bit of a laugh, I haven't a clue what to do with it'.</p> <p>2) Conservatives want to tamper with abortion law, in my mind electing them would give the other parties the idea that you can get in on the religious vote (much like America and we can all see how thats worked out).  Apart from that I just don't feel Daily Mail enough to give them my vote.</p> <p>3) New Labour.  . . . . . . . that Brown fellows ok, I guess, maybe not.</p> <p>So now I'm left with one of the marginalized partys but living in deepest darkest Suffolk we lack the crazies with money to run for those partys. So here I am first opportunity in my life to make my voice heard and nobody to represent me.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> I don't think the Tories want to do a religious hatchet job on abortion law, just consider updating it based upon recent research. If they were going to ban it and burn the doctors who used to perform it, that would be a different matter.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Dan</strong> replies:</em> I see you're point, and I'm not against legislation being reviewed and renewed. How ever I feel that the Tories have added abortion to their campaigned to gain the religious right vote, and can't vote for a party that, should it win (which it wont), would be beholden to any religious group, as many of their views are contradictory to mine.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
