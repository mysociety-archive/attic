	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> That isn't actually such a daft thing to do; on the surface it may seem simplistic, but in theory the parties do have "core values" that should be considered when choosing your party of choice. With all the spin, it may be better to vote on the basis of a party's general attitude than whatever rubbish they spout during an election campaign. If you want a party that believes in Capitalism, you want the Tories. Labour may have copied most Tory policies, but underneath there's still and undercurrent of socialism. The Lib Dems are further left still and the choice of those who think making life more "fair" will actually make life better.</p> <p>Anyway, the point is that your general impression of a party may provide a better guide to their likely behaviour than specific pledges that are rarely fulfilled.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Miss Dipsy</strong> replies:</em> Well said Gavin! There are some basic, fundamental differences in the ethoses (I don't think that's the correct plural but hey!) of the parties that do tend to guide even the least thoughful voter, and should  give you a rough idea of the kind of policies they will impliment. I am 99.999% sure I will never vote Tory (unless somewhere down the line they have some kind of radical shift in policy and all the left/centre/progressive parties swing the other way!), and that isn't through lack of careful thought! I find their whole outlook too selfish, exclusive & moralistic, and lacking in concern for future generations & people who have not been fortunate in life through no fault of their own. That's just my opinion, but it is not unobjective, and I am always prepared to revaluate my position, but it seems rather unlikely that the Tories will ever do anything to convince me to vote for them! </p>

	<p><em><strong>Miss Dipsy</strong> replies:</em> Plural of ethos is ethoi! Apparently.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
