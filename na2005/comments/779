	<dd><p>I'm not voting because every political party essentially stands for the primacy of government over the individual. Power is delegated by us to parliament, not the other way round. All wish to legislate to solve problems, often in an idiot knee-jerk fashion. <br />The assumption is always that if you don't vote you must be thick. I have 5 As at A Level, a Cambridge degree, and read the Times daily. I am interested and engaged in politics, and this is WHY i cannot vote for anyone.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Personally I'm an advocate of the Peak Oil theory; coupled with the problems of the environment even the Green party go nowhere near far enough. So at least for me, there is no-one. My hope is that turnout will be so low, reform of the electoral system will be forced on whoever wins and then maybe we might see the start of effective change. But until then, I refuse to give legitimacy to a process which is obsolete and undemocratic. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> I think there is a reasonable argument that stupid people are less likely to vote. Whether it's true or not, some people think it is the case - if you don't vote, it may be assumed that you can't be bothered or you're not interested (this is, of course, the whole point of this site - to explain that this is not the case).</p> <p>The Times gives a reasonable rundown of current events and political opinions. The Times bit was to show that he/she has an interest in and awareness of current affairs and news in general. Maybe it's not your paper of choice, but it succinctly makes the point, you petty idiots.</p> <p>The intellectual credentials were clearly provided by the exceptional A-Levels and the Cambridge degree.</p>

	<p><em><strong>John Dee</strong> replies:</em> Apologies, but I feel that "I read the Times" does betray someone who is over-confident in their intellectual prowess and ability to discriminate objective reporting from corporate agenda.</p> <p>The Times does not print objective news any more than the Sun does, it just uses longer words.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> Are the times and the sun not owned by the same person and ran on the same agenda, merely different target consumers?</p> <p>piersh makes a goodpoint about the whole spectrum, only problem being not all parties stand in all constituencies (in mine the choice is simply red blue or yellow nothing else) also i think the BNP although extremely authoritarian are in fact a left wing party not a right wing party. a lot of their policies are closer to traditional labour than conservative.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> But do they? I know a good few Sun readers who think that the most important things that happen in the world are reported in that very paper. They have no idea what goes in the majority world but could write a first class theses on whats happening in 'celeb land' and which 2 bit slapper is shagging which moronic footballer.</p> <p>sometimes i dont know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> He / she did not say that they *only* read the Times. It's a convenient short hand for showing they take an interest. I am sure the Times is not perfect, but it at least makes some effort to cover some issues. Anyway, the quality of newspapers is surely for another time. Some guide to a person's interest, level of education and social group is useful whe a point such as theirs one is being made. Sneering at their qualifications and choice of newspaper is petty and irrelevant, especially when these are key to the point that is being made.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Anyone who says things such as "Ooh aren't you a clever little person" and "Silly boy" to someone who is making a point should consider their motives for such comments. The point was in the line "I am interested and engaged in politics, and this is WHY i cannot vote for anyone" - the other stuff was just background.</p>
