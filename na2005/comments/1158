We vote every 4-5 years based on a set of promises (which aren't always kept unless you have a PhD in semantics) and on the assumption that the people we elect will deal with "matters arising" in a way we agree with.

	<p><em><strong>Matthew Brown</strong> replies:</em> Well, there are a few problems with continuos referenda</p> <p>1. You give the press much greater control on the way the country is run. You may as well give the prime-minister's job to Paul Dacre (editor of the Daily Mail).</p> <p>2. There are a number of views of which there is a majority in favour but most rational arguments against, e.g. capital punishment. I would rather the decision be in the hands of people who's job it is to know the statistics and to debate the laws, rather than the public who are most often ignorant.</p> <p>3. People would soon get bored of constant referenda, and it would waste an awful lot of time.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> There are a massive number of holes in Labour's ID card plans. Check out The Register for some of the major issues. If they ever implement it, it'll be a massive waste of time and money and will, of course, make no difference to organised crime and torrorism, as Labour say it will.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael Macpherson</strong> replies:</em> While abolishing parliament may have momentary appeal, unless we wish to resort to the Guy <br />Fawkes method we must consider how to reform the system. Also, while acknowledging the <br />creativity of the above author who wrote "with a biometric ID card I could write the software <br />for this in about a month", we frankly do not need to rely on the talents of computer tekkis. <br />More advanced forms of democracy are already in use, well tried and tested, in countries <br />similar to our GB+NI. (Democracy and gov. of course may be aided by ICT.) I am referring to a <br />synthesis of  direct democracy with the indirect, representative form (parties, parliaments <br />etc.). This involves the right of a large body of citizens to propose law, and that a law be  <br />cancelled or vetoed.  We envisage that proposals will usually go to council or parliament for <br />scrutiny and debate. Rejected proposals will go to referendum. Plenty of time is built into the <br />system for public debate and  information. The concern that ill-considered decisions will be <br />made or that cruel punishments will be introduced is unwarranted. This long process involving <br />much debate and education is by no means the same as an opinion poll. Also, we now have laws <br />about human rights which would hinder the introduction of inhumane practices. For more detail <br />about democracy reform see <br />Citizens' Initiative and Referendum I&R<br />http://www.iniref.org/<br />and to see how this works in other countries of Europe see http://www.iniref.org/conf.html</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> " I could write the software for this in about a month."<br />A few years ago I created a website that did just what you're suggesting.<br />On the site each issue could be discussed and people could put their aguments for or against, there was the ability to add links to resources supporting your aruments.<br />The site was tested using the foxhunting debate which ran for a months with a vote at the end.</p> <p>It took me about a week to create the site and it worked really with the single problem of only a very well.</p> <p>There was also significant discussion as to how this type of government by referenda could be integrated with our current system. </p> <p>RaZe</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chas Newport</strong> replies:</em> Thanks for the replies guys.  </p> <p>Matthew you see one of my points - TRUE democracy puts power in the hands of the 90 percentile who arguably don't know enough to be allowed to express an opinion (I don't necessarily think this I'm just kicking it around) This will make people act on emotion rather than logic and leaves them open to manipulation - that's what I meant by the "stability" of the first past the post system, lengthy terms of office and political elite.  You have to consistently pound away at an argument in a disciplined and logical way to get it accepted.  But it's slow and unresponsive.  However, a large majority and a weak party can mess this up as 60-70% of the population can disagree but get the Government successfully going against them.</p> <p>Gavin - what do you think of the other 80% of my message?</p> <p>Michael - thanks, I'll investigate this further.  I'm obviously taking an extreme view to stimulate a debate.  But I really do think that voting every five years on a narrow set of proposals on the assumption that one of three sets on people will continue to make decisions youa agree with is crazy.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael Macpherson</strong> replies:</em> This IS a promising exchange.  If Chas takes a look at the INIREF proposals for partial direct <br />democracy and we can review RaZe's project then the discussion can go on. For the moment I'll <br />just mention some progress in local democracy, real examples, which look good. Today I received <br />the  announcement of a meeting which will be held in Berlin where I live some of the time. The <br />meeting is to discuss the plans to introduce some options of direct democracy (DD)  in Berlin's <br />districts (Berlin is a city and federal state). Until now Berlin had no district DD and only <br />weak central DD. This would be a major advance. Why not have this in London and Glasgow? Then I <br />checked out the organisers of the meeting. It's a group of citizens' project from a district of <br />Berlin. Each of them has addressed some local issues. They have co-operated to form a network <br />which is presented in www, with info. about projects and online forum (could be improved, it <br />looks new). See http://www.buergerbuendnis.de/home.htm</p>

	<p><em><strong>RaZe</strong> replies:</em> Unfortunately I abandoned that project about 5 years ago due as there was noone seriously interested in working on it.<br />I have been considering creating a new 'Direct Democracy' simulation site for some time, but my current workload is pretty heavy so I wouldn't want to do it<br />unless there is anyone genuinely interested in the concept.

	<p><em><strong>RaZe</strong> replies:</em> I agree, when I was working on this 5 years ago I was proposing keeping parliament and MP's but reducing their 'workload'<br />by handing some of the descision making back to the public, I was suggesting a synthesis between our current representative democracy and a more direct form of democracy whereby the public has a greater say, particularly on social issues.</p> <p>A common argument <strong>against</strong> direct democracy is the belief that the public are not qualified to make many descisions, however the fact of the matter is that most MP's are not qualified either.<br />In both cases the descision makers would need to have access to expert opinion, and in either case they would then end up making the descision based on a combination of fact and emotion.</p> <p>Another way of thinking about it is: <br />   Does it matter wether or not we get the <strong>best</strong> outcome as long as we get the outcome that we <strong>want</strong></p> <p>In my concept there would be a proccess to decide who should make the choice parliament or the public. In either case it would be up to parliament to actually draft the law. The public would only choose the principals.</p> <p>RaZe </p>

	<p><em><strong>RaZe</strong> replies:</em> It's all comming back now...</p> <p>In the example used earlier (foxhunting)<br />It would be the public that decides wether or not it should be banned/allowed (the principal of the law)<br />Parliaments job would be to draft the legislation required to enact the peoples wishes.</p> <p>Obviously there would be situations where it would be innapropriate for parliament to seek public opinion (emergency situations, natioan security matters, etc..) in which case we would simply have to trust their judgement and hold them to account later.</p> <p>RaZe.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Matt B</strong> replies:</em> Have a look at the Swiss Government http://www.eda.admin.ch/oslo_emb/e/home/geninf/gov.html<br />If you don't trust people to exercise a proper choice why give them a vote anyway?  <br />It works well in Switzerland as often people listen to and follow the governments lead on major referenda.  Our system patently isn't working well but we don't have the strength to reform it.  The government can't even decide what to do with the second chamber.  I also think this would work well in the EU; we might connect more across the superstate whilst still having a measure of national (read canton in Switzerland) control .</p>

This could prove to be a powerful and creative mixture. </p> <p>People from outside of Germany are usually amazed to learn that there have been dramatic achievements in direct democracy, especially since 1990 and re-unification of the two "Germanies". In some Laender such as Hamburg and Bavaria there have been many successful "initiatives" which went to referendum. This applies at district/city as well as Land (state of the federation) levels. There's a group called "More Democracy" (some info in english) which campaigns for reform http://www.mehr-demokratie.de</p>
