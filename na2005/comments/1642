	<p><em><strong>Clare</strong> replies:</em> It our duty as citizens of Great Britain to vote in this General Election.  Surely none of you want to let Michael Howard win and be your Prime Minister, no and neither do I so get into your polling station and vote on Thursday.  It's really important, you can't say your not apathetic cos you're just as bad as the apathetic voters out there who just can't be bothered and don't care.<br />PLease I beg you to vote on Thursday.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ben</strong> replies:</em> You, the 16-year-old, you'll be 18 by the time any of these laws would be passed anyway, so it wouldn't affect you.  Also the vast majority of 16-17 year olds are not mature enough to make an informed decision on what parties to vote for and would frankly be a liability.</p> <p>Claire, the point is that we're not apathetic, we just don't want to vote.  I can't speak for everyone, but personally I don't think it's worthwhile.  I have read about each of the policies of the major 3 parties, as well as the Greens, and I find it hard to believe that they will deliver on the majority of them.<br />There's no point choosing when your choice results in pretty much the same thing.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> Strange that at 16 you can join the army (and shoot some one), have a baby, legally smoke, buy a lottery ticket, yet many people feel that you are not grown-up enough to decide who should run the country.</p> <p>Personally, I think that a lot of today's teenagers are more clued up than many of their more mature counterparts.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Rachel</strong> replies:</em> I'm 17 and am missing out on voting by 5 months. I would love to vote. However at 16 I would not have been 'clued up' enough to vote. I'm not saying all 16-17 year olds are mature enough to vote and i'm not saying they're not, but I think keeping the vote at 18 is best, many people 18+ aren't mature enough to vote either, but I feel by that age you should have the right to vote, considering you are legally an adult.<br />So what, I can smoke and have a baby and so on, that doens't make me mature. Doing those things are pretty immature actually...anyway...I can't really put this how I want to, but I do believe the voting age should not be changed...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ray</strong> replies:</em> Legal age argument means little because it can be reduced or increased by Parliament any time. These days the 16 year old are in fact much more mature than 21 year old were few decades ago because of exposure to tv and computers. Knowledge and access to it is now lot easily and widely available. Soon there would be case for 14 years old to be able to vote. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Ray</strong> replies:</em> Calre: why you feel 'none of us want Micheal Howard to become prime Minister'. He is trailing but according to Pools atleast 30 to 34% British Voters wants Tories to win. He is giving good run for money to cheating and lying Labour party. I think Labour supporters in Sedgefield should act now in the interest of their party and get Bliar kicked out. </p>

	<p><em><strong>sean</strong> replies:</em> Right on, original poster! I'm 16, and would love to vote Lib Dem in the coming election (not just because they'd lower the voting age). There are certainly a lot of people in m y age group who understand the politics. The problem isn't that their not mature, it's likely that even if they were able to vote they wouldn't.</p> <p>Either raise the age limit for joining the army, smoking (oh yes) and getting married, or lower it for voting. It just makes sense.</p> <p>It's like video and DVD ratings. Do they really think an '18' is too shocking for anyone younger? Oy!</p>

	<p><em><strong>nico</strong> replies:</em> I understand the inequalities but 16 year olds would be a complete liability in an election. i'm 18 now but when I was 16 I would have sacrificed my vote in order than no other 16 year olds voted. at 16 most have not left school and havent seen anything of the world they would be changing. They also arent affected by the majority of taxes and would generate a dangerous voting block that was only concered by a very diverse range of issues. it It's a TERRIBLE plan - but it keeps getting suggested because its a vote winner for the party that introduces it. </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>jenny</strong> replies:</em> I'm bothered by the fact that I can't vote either, but I agree with everyone else that has said that the vast majority of 16 year olds just aren't mature enough. They may think they are, but they're not, and they'll realise it in a few years.</p> <p>I think the best solution is for under 18s to just find an apethetic person with a vote to pester. <br />That way, the people that are too immature are filtered out, the young people that take an interest in politics can have their say, and the government will think there are fewer apathetic voters and we won't have to hear about how apathetic various areas of  Birmingham are on the TV. <br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Anarchy!</strong> replies:</em> So it doesn't matter that a 16yr old will be 18yr old by the time a new government make changes?</p> <p>As a 32yr old, it drives to frustration that I am governed by archaic laws and hereditary traditions born of a time well before I was born!</p>
