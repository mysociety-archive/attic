	<p><em><strong>also unable to vote because of age</strong> replies:</em> Dear 'unable to vote because of age'. There are other ways you can express your view politically without voting. Perhaps you could pursue joining a pressure group whose views you agree with. Or you could write to your mp on issues you are interested in, or to the minister of education about top-up fees, just because you can not vote at present does not mean you can not have your say. <br />On your attitude towards voting when you are 18, this seems to me perhaps a slightly immature attitude, and any MP thinking about supporting a bill to allow 16yr olds might be put off from supporting it after looking at your testimonial.</p>

	<p><em><strong>AA</strong> replies:</em> Another way to get involved is to help educate your family and friends, who are of age to vote, so that they can make a valid decision on May 5th, and not screw up the vote that they are so lucky to have.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> Yes, 16 year olds can do practically anything they want in life, whether thats inside or outside the law, and should be grateful just for that. I think 18 is a good age to become eligable to vote, by then your head tends to be better screwed on and more able to function normally.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> Remember, that upto about 1960, males in this country had the privilege of three years of being killed or maimed on the battlefield before they could vote at 21.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
