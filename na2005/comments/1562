	<p><em><strong>Mark Wilson</strong> replies:</em> How very sad that this poor child has been left behind in his educational upbringing and barinwashed into thinking that voting for a ragtag band of racists, bigots, megalomaniacs and imbeciles will be good for this collection of nations that is Great Britain aka United Kingdom.  I hope you have an epiphany or perhaps a strong mug of coffee to help kick your as yet underutilised braincells into activity.  Good luck for the future, by the way, because with the BNP elected, most of the people you know won't have any...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Lee</strong> replies:</em> Tim, you are right when you say Britain was great when it was ruled by the conservatives and liberals of the old, but that was because they were true conservatives/liberals, now they are traitors to there own name and this country.</p> <p>Mark, you seem to think that people in the BNP dont have an education i.e they are thick. Only thick people think the BNP are thick. The only people that will not have a future in Britain under a BNP government are the pedophiles and murderers that would be hung from a rope till death.</p>

Bear in mind that this is a relatively small party!</p> <p>Nick Griffin (Party Chairman)- Convicted for inciting racial hate (amonst many many many other convictions - not nessisarily race related). He also denied the holocaust happened, f*cking idiot. </p> <p>John Tyndall (inventor of the BNP)-  Has a list of convictions as long as your arm including setting up a paramilitary organisation - because they're always good for britain aren't they? He was also inprisoned for incitment to racial hatred.</p> <p>Warren Bennett (chief steward)- Convicted for football hooliganism.</p> <p>So, these people are going to help REDUCE crime ? They aren't doing a very good job at the moment.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andrew</strong> replies:</em> I think we may be missing a point here. Regardless of what the BNP really is or their agenda we're losing sight of the fact that more and more people think they represent them - now i'm not saying if thats good or bad BUT they're gaining popularity for a REASON and that is what we need to look at. Don't use the BNP as a smokescreen to hide the fact that the main parties are failing an awful lot of people....THAT is the big factor to me - that Tories and Labour is a complete joke and more and more people are seeing through it. We are seeing politics evolve... </p>

	<p><em><strong>Bob</strong> replies:</em> Ahh, thge holocaust, so it's come to this. Forget the BNP completely. If you want to debare thge holocaust and don't trust the "white supremacists" and "hatemogner" WHY oh WHY is their no free debate about this? Thr truth will stand up, only a lie needs protecting. OK, so you may be able to wash that comment off but check this BBC story http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4491231.stm where a chap says if youy want to see proof of the gas chambers then go to Auschwitz! Ha, even the director of the museum said that the gas chambers their were built in 1948! Don't trust us, here is an example, watch the video produced by the JEW David Cole that proves this when he interviewed the director! - http://www.vho.org/GB/c/DC/gcgvcole.html</p> <p>Personally I don't care if you believe me but at least you should have access to BOTH sides of a story, don't you think? Millions of Jews were brutally murdsred by the Nazis, but I do not knowe 1 person that today in this day and age  still believes the lie about gas chambers. The truth will come out just likethe lie about "soap" from Jewish flesh. Ther truth will out and people denying this evidence to be seen are NOT helping their cause.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rhia</strong> replies:</em> From http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/stopthebnp/uncovered/pg03.htm...</p> <p>"The label of Nazism tarnished the groups image, and Griffin wanted to copy the more intellectual far right parties on the continent. But though he spoke of the need for a community-based politics, his words in The Rune showed his real colours. The electors of Millwall did not back a post-modernist Rightist Party, but what they perceived to be a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan Defend Rights for Whites with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate."</p> <p>Soo, straight from the mouth of the current BNP leader. Holocaust or not, The conviction for inciting racial/religious hatred stands. Not only is this man a hippocrit (just like Hitler was) for liasing with the very people he now professes to fight against when it suited him, the man also demonstrates that he believes that racial hatred was the reason that the BNP was elected in Millwall, thus showing his true colours, and the BNP's true agenda.<br /> </p>

	<p><em><strong>Derrick</strong> replies:</em> I had the misfortune in 1945 to have helped in the liberation of Belson.There were no gas chambers. The extermination method used was simple. Inmates, not only Jews, were allowed to die in their thousands from starvation and disease. Bulldozers were being used to trundle emaciated bodies into huge pits. I can assure everybody that it was not a figment of my imagination.All the more reason then that we should vote to keep alive that very special commodity, FREEDOM.<br />Derrick Perth <br />Western Australia  </p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> Clare,</p> <p>If you ban the BNP then you become just as bad as them.</p> <p>Banning political parties is what is done in dictatorships - Saudia Arabia being a classic example.</p> <p>The BNP tends to be a vocal party, with very little real support in the UK.</p> <p>Many of their supporters like to shock people by spouting the usual racist rhetoric.</p> <p>These same people would probably have been punks during the 70's if they had been old enough.</p> <p>The BNP has never had an MP elected to Westminster, and none of their local councillors has ever been re-elected again either.</p> <p>In short they are a party of words, backed up by shock tactics, but not much else.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> While all you holocaust believers are here I'd like to ask you a simple question. According to most sources the holocaust is the extermination/gassing of 6,000,000 Jews in "death camps" such as Auschwitz, 10 years ago the curators at Auschwitz decided that the figure of "at least 4,000,000" was too high and that in retrospect no more than 1,100,000 died at Auschwitz.</p> <p>What happened to the other 3,000,000 victims? Did they come back to life?</p> <p>If the deaths at the main "extermination centre" at Auschwitz were exaggerated is it not safe to say that the deaths at all the camps were exaggerated?</p> <p>What do you think about the facts that the gas chambers were "reconstructed" after the war as well and that there is no scientific evidence that they were ever used as gas chambers as well?</p> <p>Before you all start calling me a Nazi I think I ought to tell you that my grandfather was a German Jew who spent some time at Belsen and came to Britain after the war.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> I think <em>Anonymous</em> is telling a little porky or two.</p> <p>The figure of 6,000,000 doesn't even begin to take account of the number of Poles, Russians, Hungarians, and other Slavic nations whose peoples also suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime. Many of these were never included within the final holocaust figures.</p> <p>Still, it's amazing the number of apologists who invariabley seem to have had a grandfather/grandmother/uncle/aunt  who was jew in either Auschwitz, Belsen or Triblinka.<br /></p>

Other people died at other camps.</p> <p>To take issue with the numbers again, even if only 1100000 people died in the holocaust instead of the 6000000 we all have been told, does that mean that the holocaust didn't happen? does it make the nazis of Hitlers germany any nicer?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Adam</strong> replies:</em> 'No more than 1,100,000' is hardly an insignificant number of people.  I know nothing about whether there were gas chambers or not but those people definitely died and I personally don't care how or why, it was completely inexcusable.  One 'extermination' of anyone, jew or not, would have been a travesty.</p> <p>Anyway, turning to the main point of this thread, I have just read the BNP manifesto so I could enter this debate at least partially informed.  I can certainly see the attraction of the BNP.  Lots of 'common sense' policies and lots of reliance on fact - something BNP supporters are always very keen on talking about.  </p> <p>There are two major problems with the BNP.  Firstly, the belief in self sufficiency, a danger caused by particular ethnic groups, 'voluntary registration', 'assisted repatriation' and isolation from the rest of the world smacks of national socialism.  Germany already tried that.  It worked quite well for a while and ended with millions of innocent people; jews, soldiers, every day people caught in bombing, dying.  As the old saying goes, 'one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result'.  People have long memories and will never elect a party that promises to take us the samee route that Hitler took Germany.</p> <p>Secondly, theses combined policies would, to my mind, lead to immense poverty.  Even assuming that the 20 odd million people that we are supposed to be deporting all went (incidentally, try to cast your mind back to what happened when the Nazis lost patience with the people that they didn't want in Germany not leaving), we would still have 40 million people to feed and house.  The few crops we can grow and the little bit of oil and coal we have left would not support this many people.  Our economy is based on commerce and that needs two things; people and trading partners.  In the absence of a small population or an empire, the two things that historically allowed us to be sustainable as a nation, we are unfortunately bound to play along with global capitalism.</p> <p>As a previous poster has said, the BNP is vocal and with very little real support.  Their fatal flaw, other than the sheer impracticality of their policies, is that they depend on rabble rousing and attracting the more cretinous sections of our society to appear more popular.  Whilst they have become more visible than they used to, this approach makes them seem even less credible to the vast majority of the population.</p> <p>I think we have little to fear from them in terms of government, but much in terms of their ability to play on human fear and create resentment and violent tendencies amongst white British people, whether that is what they intend or not.</p>

	<p><em><strong>sarah</strong> replies:</em> i have forgotten who actually said we never get a re-elected councillor, but i have never heard such rubbish in my life! Almost all of our councillors were re-elected once they have been able to show to the British people that they actually speak the truth.<br />    As for Nick Griffins' denial of the holocaust, can i ask you if you ever read the leaflet he had published which led him under such allegations? I seem to think that you have not, Nick Griffin outlines the lies put in place by the liberals, he also said that we should be commemorating ALL the people who died during the second world war, not just those that died at the time of the holocaust. <br />       With the things that you say, anyw=body would have thought you read "searchlight" magazine!<br /> </p>

	<p><em><strong>Amy</strong> replies:</em> After reading this thread I felt compelled to read for myself the BNP manifesto, in order to be fully informed of the discussion points. I now feel physically sick.</p> <p>The one point on which they are completely clear is the apparent need to rid this country of all non-white inhabitants, and to educate the rest of us on what it is to be "British".</p> <p>I am neither blind nor stupid, I know that this country is far from perfect, but I am also fully aware that we will not reduce hospital waiting lists, eliminate crime, or get the busses to run on time by simply making a scapegoat of a large percentage of the population.</p> <p>I for one am not in the least bothered by a person's race or religion, I am simply "anti bad person" and they occur in every shade available! (can usually be found sporting a *NP banner-insert first letter of any country here)</p> <p>The incredulous smile fell from my face while reading about the "relocation" plans, the ban on talking favourably of multi cultural societies, and the segregation of British citizens of "foreign/ethnic" descent.</p> <p>The BNP "policies" are nothing more than vague promises to improve everything and cut taxes, speaking of which how exactly can a "consumption tax" work fairly, it seems to me that goods are simply going to cost more, so if like me you are earning less than your annual tax-free allowance, you will not see an increase in your wage and so will in fact end up worse off after your weekly supermarket shop.</p> <p>I was particularly appalled by the compulsory military service for all 18 year olds, refusal of which would result in the withdrawal of the right to vote, along with the loss of any help with any form of higher/further education. And on that topic, what exactly are the unspecified "nonsense disciplines" that future students would be denied? I am assuming that my aeronautical engineering degree would be safe, although I fear certain arts courses may not be so lucky, who are they to decide how individuals may further themselves?</p> <p>With all the subtlety of a spoilt 3 year old, any organisation that has offended the BNP will be abolished along with any laws of which members have fallen foul.</p> <p>Some may fear that unemployment will rise, what with so many government departments and independent organisations being closed down, but don't panic there's plenty of room for everyone (equipped with our citizen's assault rifles) at the boarders keeping the darkies out!</p> <p>Never argue with an idiot, they always bring you down to their level, and then beat you with experience.</p>
