	<dd><p>Because  for many, many reasons. Heres Reason No. 1 - I believe in democracy.<br />When Michael Howard says "Are you thinking what we're thinking" he underlines the fascist nature of our political system. He should say "Tell me what YOU'RE thinking - and I'll take it on board". Then he would have a sweeping victory! My country is ruled by gang warfare, with fascist factions fighting over a piece of turf, one faction at any given time gaining control by protection rackets in the form of promises for benefits which rarely materialise, in exchange for extortionate taxes which never go through any accounting procedures. <br />Our so-called democratic system could work if politicians themselves were altruistic and represented the people instead of their fascist factions (euphemistically called "parties"), but it is in the nature of animals that the most ruthless and selfish will vie for power. For centuries the system has moved towards what is now deemed to be an acceptable means of representative government, but any advance towards this has had to be the result of despairing protest and revolution, of primitive jostling and competition, not of co-operation and consultancy. It is a shame that civilised people from time to time against their better nature have had to resort to such desperation, and ironically the achievement is commendable, but there is no future in it. The roost, as it stands, will always be ruled by the primitive barbarian mentality. The danger now is that people believe complacently that democracy has been achieved  because they have been told so, not because they have taken a step aside to think about it. It is time for those who do think about it to say "Enough is enough. No longer will we vote for something we do not want". <br />Given primitive communication facilities, Parliamentary Democracy in principle may have been an acceptable pragmatic method of implementing an ersatz democratic system, with its abuses being regarded as coming with the territory, but it is now anachronistic. That modern-day facilities which everyone can use to express their opinions (whether at home or in internet cafes  or, just imagine, re-vamped polling stations) are ignored by our politicians is proof that they do not have anyone's interest at heart other than their own. There is a status quo from which all party politicians benefit, whether in government or in opposition. <br />We now have the technological facility for all our voices to be heard. Obviously if there are 60 million ideas about, for example, how taxation might be applied, then there has to be a selection process to boil them down to a sensible number of feasible basic principles upon which one may vote. Instead we have a ridiculously complicated dinosaur which suits nobody (apart from the massive army of civil servants which soaks up a large amount of the takings) and which is modified only slightly by whichever party is in government.<br />And the same is true with all our national issues, which is why so many people say there is no choice to be made at an election. The floor needs to be thrown open for people to vote for issues, not parties. Government must comprise elected representatives who are concerned with managing the process of issue resolution on behalf of the nation. Political parties must cease to exist. Politicians may be deemed necessary, by definition for diplomatic roles, domestic or foreign, but the gang they represent must be the people of the UK. All such specialists must be suitably qualified and hired from the community as a whole.<br />Meanwhile, I refuse to vote for that with which I strongly disagree, which is to say almost (but not quite, I admit) everything in all the parties manifestos. Even if I were to vote for the least worst party, which is defeatist and dishonourable, I know from experience that once in power they ALL go ahead and do whatever they want without any prior authorisation from the electorate. <br />Democracy? Yes, please! As it stands, I am not apathetic - I am ANGRY. <br />(Watch this space for Reason No.2)<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Jack</strong> replies:</em> I agree with some of what you say but it is in the nature of human beings to align themselves with factions who identify with their own viewpoint, so I fear you will never see true representation of the people, by the people etc..simply because people have to do the representing and people are flawed.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael M.</strong> replies:</em> Original poster wrote: "The floor needs to be thrown open for people to vote for issues, not parties. Government must comprise elected representatives who are concerned with managing the process of issue resolution on behalf of the nation."</p> <p>Entirely agree. We need to introduce the methods of direct democracy, open to all. Citizens' law-proposal and veto, referendum on demand (after substantial information and debate), consider recall of elected representatives during term of office. To get these reforms we need a campaign --- join us at I&R http://www.iniref.org</p>
