	<p><em><strong>idle</strong> replies:</em> No vote is wasted. Just get realistic about how much your vote counts whatever party you choose.  A vote that is not for the govt. reduces their 'mandate'.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Roger Smith</strong> replies:</em> &gt;unecessary war in Iraq</p> <p>The reasons given  were not the right ones, but the war was necessary to get rid of that despot saddam who was killing his own poeple. Or is it a case of 'we are ok so why should I care about anyone else?' To do nothing would have been a bigger crime.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Matt K</strong> replies:</em> No vote is wasted, eh?  If you live in a nice safe constituency, it doesn't matter whether you vote against the sitting MP - they'll still get in. It's the same whether 2,000 or 20,000 vote against them, as long as they get the most votes.  <br />As for reducing their mandate  as a tactic, will they care?  Only about 24% of the electorate voted for the government last time around, and look at the size of their majority.  If their mandate goes down to even 20% - i.e. having 80% of voters not supporting them - they'll still be in a position to do anything they like and claim that they were democratically elected.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ray</strong> replies:</em> Roger: If reasons were wrong (no WMDs, no terrorism etc) then the war was illegal. It also had no UN mandate. Since when we start going to war in current civilized world to remove dictators. if so do you support war against Cuba, North Korea, Zambabwe or these countries do not matter as these are not neighbours of Israel nad do not have oil or oil piplines projects either. By the way, the most UN resolutions have been torn apart by Israel alone and has huge nuclear arsenal. Perhaps these do not count as at the moment they rule US mindset.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
