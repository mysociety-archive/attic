	<p><em><strong>Van Gasten</strong> replies:</em> OK, let's assume for a second that you're right. We all live in a world run by MJ12 and, like lambs to the slaughter, continue to pull the wool over our eyes with the illusion of "democracy". Fine. In this situation, your voting at these next elections will not have a negative effect on anyone. It won't help, because no-one's vote makes a difference, but it won't hurt anyone either.</p> <p>What if you're wrong though? Or at least, not right to the extent that you claim you are? In that instance, voting WILL help. So you have to make a decision between doing something that MAY help or doing something that DEFINATELY WON'T help - that is, not voting. The judgement is yours to make, but I think it's really a question of how ready you are to admit that you *may* be wrong. Think on't.</p>

	<p><em><strong>ryano</strong> replies:</em> Whilst I agree with the original poster, I think I'll vote, just in case. Mind you, I'm in a tory shoo-in and as I have no intention of EVER voting for them, my votes pretty worthless really (unless it saves someone their deposit). </p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Calm down, Tiger... Of course you can complain even if you don't vote. If neither of the two eligible parties represent your views, voting is a waste of time.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
