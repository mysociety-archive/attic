	<dd><p>All three major parties are fighting over the same middle ground.  There is no real debate and no real policy outlined - we'reessentially being asked to vote for "personlaties". That's neither right, nor worthwhile.  But while we're being asked to do so, none of them have a personality worth voting for.  Blair comes closest to a worthy leader, but I won't vote for him, nor will I make a "protest vote" for the Greens or somesuch.  I want a "none of the above" option on the vote card, then I'll go and put my X in that box.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Karl Lattimer</strong> replies:</em> Politics has now become a stage where we don't cover issues we cover icons, its just another way to dumb down the population so they can't make informed decisions or forge worthy opinions about anything.</p> <p>For instance, I have my own opinion about the elderly, that is (and it may sound callas) but if they can't pay for their own medical treatment, let them die. The elderly contribute less than a quater of the NHS income and account for 75%+ of its spending.</p> <p>The government wants to lower council tax for these health hogs? Let them pay for their heart surgery at the age of 85 themselves, the NHS should simply say, you've had a good innings now its time to die.</p> <p>Also we have other issues which are being blacked out by personality coverage, like the pension crisis, runaway housing market etc... These issues aren't covered in the election debates.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Graham</strong> replies:</em> I'm not sure that there's no debate on policies - it's just that we might like some policies from one party, and some from another, but there's no way of getting the best policies from each party being implemented. Maybe if we coalition governments, we might get somewhere. Maybe.</p> <p>But the fact that 3 parties fight over the same middle ground reflects the opinion of the electorate - we are middle ground on average. That's why we extremists at either end of the political spectrum don't get anywhere, and rightly so. Labour's move from left to centre made them electable. </p> <p>As for old people... you could say they've contributed enough to the NHS over the course of their lives, maybe it's time they got their money's worth ;)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Bob</strong> replies:</em> Karl, firstly, learn to spell. It's callous, not callas. And as far as letting 'old people die', Graham makes an obvious point you must be a real idiot to miss, they've paid tax all their lives, so they deserve to get decent healthcare, at the time when everyone is most likely to need it. You have the same selfishness lack of compassion that I see in many leading politicians. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> You might want to check up on your grammar there, Bob. You may not agree with someone's opinions, but picking on their spelling is a low blow.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
