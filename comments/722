	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> It's true that the lack of social conscience has become more widespread over the years and I fear this is only going to get worse as people get more disillusioned with politics in general and decide to do things "their own way". Sadly there isn't a party who seem to have even recognised this problem of social conscience - they'd all rather break it down into individual little soundbites to grab a select few votes. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Bri</strong> replies:</em> Ususally not...I refer to a case in Scotland. An MSP was in her constiuency and was being heckled by chavs/neds gesturing and shouting in front of the camera. One little tyke was named and shamed by a paper who contacted the family. Their response was beyond belief. The mother of said ruffian actually said she would punch this MSP in the face(or something along these lines)!?!? I dont get it. They should be put down.</p>

	<p><em><strong>jb</strong> replies:</em> I'm not even sure we should use the term 'social conscience' in relation to many people walking the streets today,,,,</p> <p>The problem is far far deeper than that, they are the result of a society that in effect rewards you for doing nothing if you so choose.</p> <p>Yes - you won't ever be wealthy,<br />but if you have low aspirations then the state is quite happy to support your quest for doing nothing......</p> <p>sick of it. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Azriphale</strong> replies:</em> But "there is no such thing as society"! For those too young to remember this is a Thatcherism.</p> <p>Oh and while we are on the subject of social conscience, don't you think you have a social responsibilty to vote?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Right-wing politics are hardly the cause of this. Being able to have a perfectly comfortable lifestyle without having to work is a socialist thing. People who have no choice should be supported. People who just cannot be bothered should not.</p> <p>I think the parties all recognise the problem, but it's very, very difficult to solve - at least without causing a lot of suffering to those who do not deserve it. Ultimately, children are the problem. Society feels it is appropriate to care for the innocent, so all you have to do is have a baby if times are hard and you'll be supported. Of course, life is generally still very tough for poor parents, which is not good - but if you make it too easy then even more people would choose that option. It's really not an easy problem to solve.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
