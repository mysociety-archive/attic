	<dd><p>Out of office they promise the moon and stars and once elected they take it all away.  They also look after their own interests eg vote their own pay rises and pension packagaes whilst everyone else is made to tow their line.  They breed waste in the public sector and they throw money at their friends in the legal and financial organisations (look at the annual contracts handed to PWC, Ernst Young etc.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jeffrey</strong> replies:</em> So elect in a politician with no political experience.  Say, the Liberal Democrats if you're on the left or UK Independance if you're on the right.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Stu</strong> replies:</em> who ever you vote for, you pay the same tax for the same things, nothing changes but the cosmetics. It makes no real differance who gets in to power of the main three partys. The only thing we neet to avoid is letting nutters like kilroy-silk, ukip, BNP, green party or any other radical party with blinkers on. they only realy care about single issues such as the environment (green) staying out of europe (ukip / kilroy) racism (bnp) and dont realy care about any other issues... or worse still try to look at all isues through the jaded view point of their key objective. on the whole there is little point in voting one of the three in over any of the other three, so long as one of the three get in .... after all better the devil you know.</p> <p>Stu</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> "Elect in a politician with no political experience" - is that really a good policy? Try and find someone who doesn't know how to do the job?</p> <p>Incidentally, while the Lib Dems may be a large party, they still have no recent governing experience and could create a variety of problems of their own. Labour and the Tories are the only known quantities (and they are very similar indeed).</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> So we should only ever vote for a "known quantity" then? The rest of the parties may as well all pack up and sod off then, huh?!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
