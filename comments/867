	<p><em><strong>Tom Smith</strong> replies:</em> What absolute nonsense... we haven't come very far from the days of the 'medievil serfs' you describe. The money stays on the top as it always has, you have no say in the way anythings done, you're constantly exploited, manipulated and propagandised... except now we have running water and we get to shop at Tescos.</p> <p>I'm not trying to belittle the achievements made so far, and agree that they are praiseworthy, but lets not stop here....</p>

	<p><em><strong>Paul</strong> replies:</em> Maybe back in the good old days, politicians might have listened to the 2 million people matching in London against the Iraq war, and they might not have been the lying, two faced, media whores that we have to settle for these days.</p>

	<p><em><strong>PapaLaz</strong> replies:</em> To Original Poster:</p> <p>If you are going to vote then why are you here in the first place? Just bugger off and vote and shut up about it. You sound like one of these religious nuts who sing loudly and out of tune in church and then look with contempt on anyone who didn't sing as loud as you. What do you want, a medal? </p> <p>For your info, having the choice of whether to vote or not means just that - a choice. Who gave you the right to criticise anyone who wants to exercise the democratic choice to abstain? Most of those who aren't going to vote have given their reasons, good or bad, and left it at that. I haven't heard too many going round gobbing off trying to persuade people who ARE voting to abstain - although the basis for criticism of their choice is equally valid, in my eyes. We COULD say that all those who are going to vote are unthinking sheep who mostly haven't even fully considered the policies they will support. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Martin Lowe</strong> replies:</em> PapaLaz</p> <p>If you want to sit on the sofa watching soaps and reality TV on the 5th May, then more fool you for not realising that elections aren't just about voting people in but also about voting people OUT.</p> <p>The best way for Britain to be more democratic right now would be a hung parliament, and if you were to use your vote tactically you could help bring this closer.</p> <p>Withdrawing from the electoral process isn't going to change anything. And anyone who celebrates the fact that they are withdrawing from the process is really nothing more than a childish sulk. And in the long term dangerous - if we don't use the vote, we'll lose the vote.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
