	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Eh? You are SUPPOSED to be voting a Memeber of Parliament for your particular constituency on an issues basis... NOT voting for Tony or Gordon -- or even for a political party!</p> <p>You are "meant" to be adult, serious and responsible about this, for voting is a hard-fought for and important business!</p> <p>This means that if you are eligible to vote, and intend to vote, that you ought to make some effort to meet each candidate, ask appropriate questions and study the promises they are making that will affect you and the constituency.</p> <p>In considering the NATIONAL issues -- things like war, taxes, unemployment, education and so forth, you must keep in mind that YOUR MP is your connection -- he/she is your REPRESENTATIVE... through them you have a voice in the House of Commons on war, NHS cut backs and so forth... you have a say NOT JUST AT AN ELECTION! So you HAVE to vote for YOUR MP, not a party and not a leader fo a party!</p> <p>You simply weigh it all up and cast your considered vote for the candidate.</p> <p>What the heck has that got to do with "Tony" or "Gordon" -- they are merely employees/ civil servants paid to do a specific job FOR US.</p> <p>If you were suggesting that you wanted to vote for Tony because "you kinda like him as a person", but were annoyed because you might get Gordon -- and you don't like him as much... then you should not be allowed to vote in good conscience!  That's irresponsible and ludicrous!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rory</strong> replies:</em> I understand what you are saying about the fact that you are only meant to be voting for YOUR MP and not the government/person you want to be prime minister, but come on, you know that that is not the case? Even the parties know this, which is why the election campaigns have focused so strongly on the leaders of the parties as people. Tony Blair will have much more of an effect on my life than my local MP.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Au Contraire.</p> <p>Tony cares not a jot about you, he doesn't know about you nor about your constituency.  he has his own constituency to care about as well as the broad national policies.</p> <p>In general, in the House of Commons, most business is done by committees of MPs, most debates and votes are done by MPs quoting constituency feedback, letters from your neighbours, petitions and so forth.</p> <p>Each MP is fighting for their particular constituency to benefit from new factories, shops, development grants, for more police, for improved amenities, utilities, schools and hospitals -- it's a huge fight among MPs over how the kitty is divided up.</p> <p>You need to vote in an MP in whom you have confidence in his/her ability to do the best for your area.</p> <p>On matters of party policy, manifesto pledges that affect the entire nation... then your MP has to follow the Whip, and put the national interest ahead of the local constituency's interests.</p> <p>This is relatively rare when compared with the day-to-day business of an MP. It generally falls to foreign policy, immigration, the exchequer and economic business, war, trade deals and investments.  In such matters your MP is merely a vote in the house, not an opinion nor a voice for your constituency -- but even then, he/she is obliged to raise matters (such as petitions and protests) ... and then follow the whip and toe the party line.</p> <p>I trust that this has convinced you that your "Come on..." and notion that Tony Blair has a significant role in what affects you and your local area is nonsense.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Tiger43 is taking the mickey-monkey... "just vote" -- Sheesh, these people ARE "just voting" -- willy-nilly, and without any understanding of the damn system!  They don't know how it works, they don't understand the consequences, and they still "just vote".</p> <p>It beggars belief.<br />*sigh*</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To dcd.....Perhaps "just vote" is a bit simplistic, I concede your point. Its just that I strongly beleive in voting after as much consideration and deduction that you can do before deciding which lucky party will get your cross. </p> <p>Maybe I should start the "Votist Party", I don`t know. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> The "Votist Party" would have one single aim. And that is to encourage people not just to vote, but for those who say they know little if anything about politics to find out and learn more. Of course the party will assist.</p> <p>True its only one policy and it wouldn`t exactly make us government material, however, that would not be the aim. Simply that the "Votist Party" would do its level best to educate people more on the subject and try and make it more intersting, with the single party aim of getting more people to vote.</p> <p>All parties whatever there views hopefuly would like us for this and  if they attempted to slag us off, it would only be detremental to themselves. Of course we could quite happily criticise them without any comeback. Plus the fact that we would be no threat to them as we are not aiming for government.</p> <p>If there are floors in this idea, taking into account I have only just thought of it, please let me know. All sensible improvements to the "Votist Party" are welcome.<br /></p>
