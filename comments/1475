	<p><em><strong>Mark Golding</strong> replies:</em> Hi there.  Your words are very familiar! I hear myself saying things like this frequently.<br />I hope you don't mind me commenting but I think people like you are potentially the very body politic that will bring change to this country's political impasse.<br />I bet you can communicate well.  How would you like to network with me and begin an Action Group in your area.  Whatever you can contribute in time and expertise willl be an asset and, believe me, it is only a matter of time before Direct Democracy sweeps away the old order.  But small streams have to be collected into larger ones until the river is wide enough to wash away the foundations of old encrusted practices. The more people 'we' recruit the greater the flow. <br />If you are keen and really want to put your words into action, email me. office@markgolding.com<br />Off the cuff agenda can be seen at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Democracy-Forum/message/123</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> the concept of democracy in our country is a sham.can nobody outhere see that the same agenda is being pursued by the big three?  the election is nothing but a game played out for the benefit of the masses to make us think that we are engaged with the political process and that we have a bearing on events. all the while the real agenda of change grinds on un-noticed. the biggest ally to our leaders (whoever they really are?)is an electorate that cannot form thoughts and ideas that are outside of the "correct" viewpoint which is fed via a controlled media.</p>

	<p><em><strong>reply</strong> replies:</em> what a great feeling it is to here other people who are awake to this hoax of a political system. How many people know that mi5 and mi6 each payed £100,000 to alquaeda in the 90's. <br />Behind closed doors the bilderbergers who groomed Blair to power to the committee of 300, the trilateral commission and many other groups of this web of control.</p>

	<p><em><strong>j4ck</strong> replies:</em> I will not vote, fed up with the propaganda. Voting would be like saying one approves of the way things are run and i cannot agree with that.</p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> everybody should vote! the power of change does lie within our grasp. however, what lies outside the grasp of the electorate is the reality of the game they think they are involved in. the political set rely on the two-dimensional thinking of the masses to re-elect the same unrelenting agenda time after time. voting labour because your dad did or the "sun or "mirror" tells you to is not good enough.....if you want any change at all you must vote outside the big three.</p>
