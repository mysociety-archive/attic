	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> What's so bad about the Tories? The Labour party is only in power now because they copied all the Tory policies and dropped all of their own. Blair is a Tory! If it wasn't for the Iraq war, he'd still be as popular as ever (most likely) and could carry on being the Tory he's been for years. Brown is a Tory, too. Face it, we have the Tory party at the moment. They just pretend they're not Tories. At least Howard & Co show their true colours..!</p> <p>What is it, some kind of anti-capitalist thing? Is the idea that if you work hard you can achieve a better standard of living SO bad? The Tories are as happy as anyone to support a social security system to account for people going through a bad patch (or whatever), they're happy enough to have an NHS - all the socialist things that actually matter are on the Tory agenda. So what is it? Do they have to paint themselves red and pretend to be the Labour party to get in, now?</p> <p>Seriously, I'm not that pro-Tory, but there seems to be this band of people who hate them without and any reasoning at all - you just get "I would never vote Tory". All the parties are the same for heaven's sake! Do people not like blue any more or something?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> The original poster appears to be contradicting himself/herself !!!</p> <p>He/She will not vote for either the Lib Dems or the SNP as they are  <em>irrelevent</em>, but he/she would vote for a minority party ???</p> <p>Surely, by virtue of the fact that it is a minority party, makes it irrelevant in the eyes of the poster ? </p> <p></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
