	<p><em><strong>Rob</strong> replies:</em> I agree whole-heartedly, and will be voting for the Lib Dems just because I think that a shake up of our tired, stupidly confrontational two party system will help to take absolute power out of a small group of peoples hands. Anyone who has decided not to vote as a protest should realise that this protest would be felt more by the current government if they cast their vote with another party</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jax</strong> replies:</em> This is what I think, change doesn't happen instantly but it's progressive.<br />I think the first change we need is a three party system, then four and eventually, more independants and hopefully eventually a system without static parties (like we have at the moment).</p> <p>The whole "Prime Minister" thing was supposedly just a piss-take to start with anyway, wasn't it ("ooh your the "PRIME" minister" - as they're all supposedly peers)?<br />We used to function witout parties back in the 1700's.</p>

	<p><em><strong>qwerty</strong> replies:</em> I like the idea of an entire Parliament full of Independents.  Who on earth would they have as Prime Minister, Home Secretary, etc?  How would they decide?  It would require a degree of cooperation that is very rarely seen in the House at the moment...! </p>

	<p><em><strong>Jax</strong> replies:</em> Imagine if the cabinet was voted on by the whole house with no whip allowed.<br />Now that could lead to some interesting results.</p> <p>I don't mind the position of the Prime Minister being available but I don't think that the Prime minister should have as much power as he has at the moment, his role should be ensuring the departments work well together, I don't think the Prime Minister should propose policy for example.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
