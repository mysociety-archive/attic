	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> Well, when you commit a crime and partake in illegal activities, then this is the price you have to pay unfortunately.  When you broke the law and were convicted, you lost out on your freedom and rights to vote.  Tough luck, mate.  Maybe next time you'll think twice before being a burden on law-abiding citizens who are subsiding your stay in prison, where you are fed for free and provided with a roof over your head, rent-free!</p>

	<p><em><strong>John Furlong</strong> replies:</em> Without meaning to sound cynical - your "vote" does count nonetheless. What I mean of course is that your inability to vote goes into the pool of "non-votes" - ultimately either you didn't care or did not know or simply took the chance that you would loose your vote this way. Politicans and the political system does pay attention to this vote. Very much so actually.</p> <p>However I must admit I know nothing as to why you are in jail.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>RKP</strong> replies:</em> I doubt you are really in prison, but let's suppose that you are. You committed a crime and have therefore opted-out of society. That's the price you pay. I didn't commit a crime and so get to vote. See how it works?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom</strong> replies:</em> I don't know what crime Reggie comitted, but in response to RKP's comment I DO know for sure that no-one has ever asked him if he would like to opt in or out of society. I know you were not implying this to be the case, but my point is that an individual cannot possibility disassociate themselves from a society whose governing body has the power to imprison them for breaking its laws. Reggie did not ask for his freedom and rights to be placed under the control of a government, but since this is the way of the world he should at least be allowed a say in who sits at the head of this government, whatever his criminal convictions. Comments on my opinions would be very welcome, either on this site or via e-mail</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
