	<dd><p>I refuse to endorse the gang of traitors who turned my homeland into a police state while simultaneously allowing it to be colonised by the dregs of Africa Asia and Eastern Europe.  This election has seem third world political practices to match the third world public services; postal votes are stolen by the sackful and politicians grandstand with the troops abroad while reducing them to the status of badly funded re-enactment society.  The poor veterans of Hitler's war are robbed and battered to death in their own homes for the sake of their meagre pension while the police run around arresting people for alleged 'racist remarks' and seizing home computers in this so-called democracy and the only certainty is that taxes WILL go up just as soon as the election is over.  They don't even try to deny it any more!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Brentwood Resident</strong> replies:</em> I agree with this man/woman. We Brits were never asked if we wanted OUR country to become a foreign land. It is called democracy - an alien concept to you left-wing traitorous bastards.</p> <p>If you oppose the 'Right-wing' then why don't YOU go and live in the perfect Communist utopia of North Korea and see how long you will last before starving to death?</p> <p>If you have a BNP candidate today, then vote BNP.

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> Max; I didn't understand your point the first, second, third or fourth time.</p> <p>Brentwood Resident: theirs a middle ground between communist and facist, that's where the majority of this country stand.</p> <p>Point being, if you don't like this country, leave, for the most part, I do. The multi-cultural  society I live in is something that makes me proud of my country, the BNP is something for this country to be ashamed of, what you don't seem to understand when you rant on about democracy is that most people in this country don't share your beliefs.</p> <p>If direct democracy was imposed and everyone was asked, 'should we throw these immigrant out of the country?' This country would say no!</p> <p>If the country was asked 'should we throw the BNP out and all of it's supporters?' you probably wouldn't fair too well.</p>

	<p><em><strong>MG</strong> replies:</em> Al, whilst I agree with several of your points namely that there is a middle ground and that a multi-cultural society is one to be proud of, I am not so sure that I agree with your assertion as to the majority's view.  If asked, most people would probably say 'No' to expelling immigrants, although I do not believe that this would be a fair reflection of the majority of this countrys hard working tax payers or pensioners views.  It is more a reflection of the fact that we now live in a society where openly expressing views that do not conform to what has been deemed politically correct, by a vociferous minority, is frowned upon and, as such, individuals feel increasingly unable to voice their opinions for fear of retribution.  Instead, they simmer on what they feel to be wrong and unjust, which in turn provides fuel and ammunition for the extremist parties.</p> <p>The issue of immigration is one that is important to a significant proportion of this country and one that in my opinion needs to be addressed.  Only by implementing robust controls over immigration, which curbs the inflow of those that do not/will never contribute to our society whilst accepting and actively encouraging those that will, will we be able to address this situation.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> Yes, but I the question wasn't 'do you think we should reduce the number of people coming into the country?', the question was asking whether people that have moved here from other countries  should be thown out. On that question the majority would answer no.</p> <p>I agree immigration needs to be controlled and probably differently to the way it's done at the moment.</p>

	<p><em><strong>MG</strong> replies:</em> Al... in that case, the response to your question will depend upon what the person in this country is contributing.  If they are law abiding and contribute to society then you are right, most people would not want them thrown out.  If on the other hand they were found to be fraudulently claiming benefit, working on the black market and therfore not paying their dues or actively involved in crime, then I disagree, as I think the majority of people would be in favour of deportation.  Why as a nation would we want to keep and support such undesirables?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Arthur Wilson</strong> replies:</em> The logic and methodolgy of immigration needs to be changed.</p> <p>There should be much more emphasis on the stability and cohesive nature of Britain.<br />That means more focus being placed on compatable immagrants. People who will become part of an integrated and cohesive society.<br />I would include in that - Eastern Europeans, West Indians, Other Europeans, English speaking countries.<br />I would not encourage peoples from the Indian sub continent. There is clear and ample evidence (almost three generations) that peoples from this region have no wish to become part of Britain. They wish to retain their own culture, language etc. Living in sepperate and closed communities.</p> <p>This is not compatible with cohesion.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy Kerr</strong> replies:</em> In answer to the question from MG.<br />Yes I would have no problem in deportation of people:<br />1) they have broken ANY law and are citizens of a seperate country.<br />2) are breaking ANY rules of their asylum.<br />3) Asylum seekers should be retained in a seccure environment with no benefits - they should be processed within 24 hrs and a decision made. If there is any doubt in the matter then their claim should be rejected.<br />4) Anyone who  has entered the country illegially and have had their asylum claim rejected - they should be deported immidiately back to the third party nation they came from (France, etc).<br />No asylum claims should be accepted from anyone entering the country by any means other than through the embassies or the UN.<br />5) All ecconomic migrants should be assesed by a clear and non-negociable points system. What they can do and do we need it.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Bengali Brit Living in USA</strong> replies:</em> I don't get this. There is no country in the world that is "pure". Britain was invaded by Vikings and Normans - and slowly infiltrated by Irish and many other ethnicities since. Most Brits are a mix of different races. Every country in the world is like this. In the longer history of the world, it is and impossible to identify a pure racially based country. This is what makes the world stronger. Anyone who doesn't get this is just plain ignorant. </p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> FYI we emigrated to a multiracial, but NOT multicultural land.  We have the good grace not to demand the city builds a village green to play cricket on, or the Queen's English be taught in local schools.  Nor do we get "offended" by our host nation's customs and instituions or demand preferential treatment in public services.  There are around 400 British ex-pats also here in a town of 10,000 but we don't have our own ghetto............</p> <p>SM, PJ and Al are prime examples of why we did leave the country, and why we won't be back!  </p> <p>Dare to speak the truth and you get a storm of abuse and denounced as "racist" (apparently the 21st century version of "heretic") from the know-nothings - not one reasoned argument in defence of their failed multicultural socialist utopia....they cannot disprove what I've said, so they resort to pesonal attacks 'the last refuge of a scoundrel'.  This makes them no better than the self serving party hacks who have sold Britain down the river.</p> <p>Think I'll go out and have a cold beer by the pool now.  </p>

	<p><em><strong>original poster</strong> replies:</em> Well the climate IS a bonus, and the doc did advise moving to a warmer dry climate but the real overriding reason (apart from crime)is money;  We cannot afford to live on our pensions in the UK.  Mine is a war disability while my wife just retired from NHS nursing and while Bliar and Brown have taxed us out of sight, we remember only too well being in negative equity under Howard's crew last time.  Never again!</p> <p>So we really don't have a horse in this race.  </p> <p>Yes, we ae immigrants too, which is why we must adapt to the local laws and customs and not expect them to change for our benefit, unlike so many who flock to GB.  This is an important difference which those who cry 'racist' fail to grasp.  Actually we have black neigbours here!</p> <p>I'll own up to the belly but not the beer (I like Keystone ice, but it's not exactly local); I don't own anything with a Union Jack on, let alone underwear. I don't read any UK newspapers, they are far too depressing!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
