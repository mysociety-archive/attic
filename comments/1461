	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> How about Micheal Howard (2nd generation immigrant)? And shouldn't you vote for a party rather than a leader? Tony may have excessive power, but in most parties there are other people who have an appropriate level of influence.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Garry</strong> replies:</em> Perhaps there is no England left.</p> <p>All we have are millionaires with offshore accounts.<br />Enterprising Immagrants with loyalties elsewhere.<br />A mass exodus of the able.</p> <p>All we will be left with are a bunch of Chav's in fenced in estates - ASBO'd and electronically tagged and a patchwork of small bubbles of global cultures.</p> <p>If people want to see what England was then they can watch some black and white films in a museum somewhere.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To Gary......Stop nit picking about Tom Baker being half Jewish. He`s as English as scones with jam and cream on. I suppose your`e going to tell me that scones originated from Iceland, the country, not the frozen supermarket store.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Garry</strong> replies:</em> Tiger43 - No picking of the nits from me.<br />I was just stating the absurdity of BNP / Islamist positions.<br />How about some warm beer and cricket there's a special 2 for 1 offer in Morrison's. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To Gary... Sounds great, not sure however about playing cricket in a Morrison`s supermarket though, wouldn`t some of their groceries get damaged? I love warm beer though. Can`t understand why our American cousins won`t have a drink without huge mouthfuls of ice. I mean, whats wrong with them, its not as if they live in a desert where it only rains once every 100 years. Don`t know about the cricket though, football fan myself, Liverpool to be precise, and before anyone comes back with any silly comments about Liverpool FC. No English club will ever, and I mean ever acheive what Liverpool did in the late 70`s and throughout the 80`s, so there. </p>

	<p><em><strong>sue</strong> replies:</em> yeah this excess of ice in all the drinks here is annoying; I think it's also to cut costs and provide very little soda in ratio to large amounts of ice.<br /> However, in Texas it gets so Bl**dy hot in summer that it's practically desert and it does cool you down<br /></p>

<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
