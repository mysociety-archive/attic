How any one can call these safety cameras I have no idea.</p> <p>Money cameras may be a better description.</p> <p>I am all for cameras in towns and newar schools, shops whatever but the ones out there operating as a flashing cash register drives me bananas.</p> <p>And please please please don't blurt out with the old crap "Don't speed and you wont get caught". That arguement is very tiring.</p> <p>I'm not advocating speeding simply that cameras that are strategically placed to make money should be removed.</p> <p>Remember the governemt said. "OK,OK it's not fair we'll remove the dodgy ones" . And then a few months down the line, i assume after doing some sums, they changed their mind?</p> <p>And I know what they say that the money goes into road safety campaigns or back into the roads etc.</p> <p>One word: Bollocks!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Kirsten</strong> replies:</em> Don't you actually have any real, important views on what to base your decision to vote or not?! You'll be thankful you're not behind bars when you avoid hitting a child near a place where there is a speed camera, where under your preferred government you would have hit and killed the child whilst travelling over the speed limit. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Philip Wright</strong> replies:</em> I agree!  I live in Warwickshire and I reckon that around 75% of the speed cameras, whether fixed or mobile, are placed in positions which could in no way be described as danger spots.  In addition as a driver with over 30 years driving experience I am appalled at the standard of driving you see on the roads daily.  Speed cameras have done nothing to improve driving standards at all.  Improvement in road saftey is more related to improved safety measures in more modern vehicles.  The cameras are at best a cynical money generating exercise with only minimal effect on raod safety.</p>

	<p><em><strong>PetrolHead</strong> replies:</em> If everybody drove with consideration for all other road users, pedestrian and drivers, then you would need no speed restrictions at all, as everybody would be driving to the conditions around them at the time. Therefore as the majority of road users are selfish inconsiderate idiots then total kaos is what we all deserve and get.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Noo</strong> replies:</em> speed cameras encourage drivers to look at their speedo not at the road/hazards/conditions.</p> <p>Personallly I would prefer not to be run over at all than to be run over at 30 mph by someone doing the speed limit and therfore perfectly 'safe'.</p> <p>I am not sure if I will vote/who for.  The bit that pickles me is that ideally, living in Wales, I would like my local councillor to be Plaid Cymru- he has been great the last couple of years;  however Plaid are clearly never going to win for London, so do I get the choice to vote for e.g. conservative in London but Plaid for local?</p>

	<p><em><strong>heather</strong> replies:</em> It's not so much the money making aspect that gets me, it's all the near accidents caused by people who are driving at the correct speed but insist on jamming their brakes on anyway when they see a camera.  Emergency breaking should be for emergencies as it's not a safe thing to do and cameras expose other road user to this risk every day.</p>

	<p><em><strong>steve palmer</strong> replies:</em> There is of course plenty of evidence that driving too fast leads to more accidents and as I'm sure anyone can work out the faster you're driving, the more damage you cause if you do have an accident.</p> <p>But is this really a reason not to vote anyway? </p>
