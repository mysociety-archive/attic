	<dt>Illision of democracy and that you count</dt>
	<dd><p>There are many reasons why I am not going to vote and never have.<br />The main one is we have big problems in this country and just simply "they never get solved".  I am interested into politics and what happens however just because I don&#8217;t vote does not mean I do not have my opinions and cannot voice them.  Just who listens to the people these days?</p> <p>No party has the peoples best interests at heart.  They all seem to lie just to get in power, and then change all their policies and manifestoes after they get in.  The people cannot do anything about it after they have been elected.</p> <p>All they do is talk and no action.  I am under the impression that there was more man hours dedicated to the Fox hunting ban compared with the investigation and talks for going to war in Iraq.  Can anyone really say that this is correct ? Nothing happened when over 2 million people protested against Iraq and we as people and the country all new the government was lying and new they did not have all the facts. But could not do anything about the dictated decision that was made.</p> <p>My main point is action!! No matter what party will get in NOTHING will ever be done and nothing seems to change.  Youth trouble is getting worse, not feeling safe to walk down your road, no respect for elders, no values in our society, Britain is a rip off financially.  I feel its like a pointless task encouraging the illusion of a democratic country.  The PM dictates what happens and we have seen that with Iraq, and many other policies.  </p> <p>The illusion that we have a free and democratic country.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>ryano</strong> replies:</em> Big buisness and the financial markets now run the country. Whoever gets in will just adopt policies that perpetuate this. </p>

	<p><em><strong>piersh</strong> replies:</em> This is a very exaggerated summary of the problems this country faces. As with so many who post here, I think this is self-indulgent - how sympathetic would the billions living in extreme poverty & in repressive regimes be to your concerns I wonder.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael M.</strong> replies:</em> The populist movement, which advocated the use of referendum, grew in the late nineteenth century USA in an effort regulate corporate power. A related movement in Europe strengthened citizens' democracy, for instance in Switzerland. With direct democracy the people can take charge and legislate on issues which they select. See www.iniref.org</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> There are certainly much worse places to live, piersh, but that is not what this forum is about. If this country is going to retain its standing in the world, we need to have politicians who will genuinely tend to the needs of the population. Just because other people in other places are worse off than us does not mean we should be 100% happy with everything. Our current government is becoming increasingly repressive and we do have to keep tabs on this behaviour if we want to maintain the freedom we have.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> The only danger is Gavin, is that if the government continues to ignore public concerns I can see the people of Britain becoming revolting. And I for one would not like to see a revolting Britain, for I value cleanliness Gavin,(even if I can`t spell it)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris Marsh</strong> replies:</em> Hundreds of people went to prison, were tortured and died so that you and I could have the right to vote. We have a duty to use our vote.<br />I will be spoiling my vote because while I agree with a lot of what people are saying on this site, it is better to use your vote to vote for no-one than not to vote at all.</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> Chris: If you have to vote then may be you would consider voting for the least known. It would help the bugger save his deposit and would also give a jolt to the main contenders or those who think they are safe with big majority such as Blair, Brown, Howard and the rest like them. Have fun.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Craig</strong> replies:</em> "I am under the impression that there was more man hours dedicated to the Fox hunting ban compared with the investigation and talks for going to war in Iraq. Can anyone really say that this is correct ?"</p> <p>Erm, it was in their manifesto. Everyone forgotten that, have they?</p> <p>I'm fed up with all this doom and gloom and nay-saying. I'm a student (and I'm doing fine financially although top-up fees might change that) and what I see in the UK is a great and talented nation which practically invented the 20th century and has already made great contributions to the 21st (think web, genetics etc.).</p> <p>I like the EU, I support London2012, I don't fear immigration and I'll vote Lib Dem because I believe that they're more than a real "alternative"...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Michael</strong> replies:</em> Assuming 2 million should be listened to?  I know, lets dispense with the rubbish system we have and let anyone who can gather support from 2 million people dictate actions.  There was action alright, Iraq was invaded and freed, how about that for action?  Sorry you didn't get the full "woodstock" experience, fling baby poo at returning soldiers, that sort of thing.  </p>
