	<p><em><strong>SM</strong> replies:</em> You are too stupid to delete the "write your reasons here", which is set up to delete itself anyway, so you obviously won't be able to listen to reason.  But you are clearly a moron.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris</strong> replies:</em> I feel the same way. I've got no BNP candidate standing in my constituency either, and I can't bring myself to vote for the pathetic 'Little Englanders' of UKIP. Time for a spoilt paper with "BNP X" written across it, methinks/</p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> why must somebody be branded a "moron" purely for having a valid viewpoint?. it is, in all honesty a very factual statement.does this mean that large sections of society should not have their views represented and that anybody who does not buy into the lib/lab/con establishment deception is a moron? doesnt sound like democracy to me.</p>

If they don't have anyone standing in my area, I may have to go for the "Easy to identify scapegoat party".</p>

	<p><em><strong>Barry</strong> replies:</em> So I am a "moron" am I, Gavin? Just because I love my country and want to see my nephews (born in 1998 and 2000 respectively) grow-up in a country they can call their own and if they are lucky enough to live to 90 or 100 years of age not be forced to submit to Allah's will in a 'British' Islamic Republic which we WILL be by then as we Brits are due to become the MINORITY by 2050 according to esteemed Oxford University-educated demographer (person who studies and predicts population trends)John Coleman.</p> <p>Is Patriotism a crime? Did our soldiers in World War 1 and 2 die for nothing?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> <br />Your a moron because first you couldn't work out how to delete the "Write your reasons here..." text and then you couldn't even work out who'd called you a moron. It was in fact SM. Your also a moron because you beleive someone purely because they are Oxford University educated. </p> <p>Demographic trends are not a prediction of what will happen, they are a demonstration of what could happen if the current trend continued, which it won't, with or without the BNP in power and thankfully it will be without.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SM</strong> replies:</em> Moron writes: "does this mean that [...] anybody who does not buy into the lib/lab/con establishment deception is a moron?"</p> <p>No.  I don't fit into that category myself.  I have two reasons for calling you a moron.  First, you left in the "Write your reasons here..." text.  And secondly, you think voting BNP is a good idea.</p> <p>Anyone who thinks supporting a fascist and racist organisation is a good idea is a moron, and my enemy.  You disgust me.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> I've got no BNP candidate in my constituency either, but then again the last BNP candidate who stood in my constituency lost his deposit as he failed to muster even 100 votes (he got a total grand of 67).</p> <p>Even the <em>Save our Hospitals</em> candidate polled more votes than the chicken-spanker from the BNP.</p> <p></p>
