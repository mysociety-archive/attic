	<dd><p>This is not about political ideoligies anymore. I used to vote Labour  (when they were Labour) and have been dismayed to see them leave their committment to people behind in pursuance of staying in power.I could not bring myself to vote conservative having watched them systematically destroy the area i grew up in when they were in power and as for the Liberal Democrats !! Well, those are my reasons and for all those who are voting this year, i hope you get what you deserve.  xx</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> What about the Lib Dems? Although not a supporter by any means I'm interested to know what people have against them. The most common excuse is "they're wishy washy" or "their policies don't make sense, or don't add up". Do Labours? Do the Conservatives? To me they all lack credibility in one way or another - so why is it that so many people dismiss the Lib Dems so readily??</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> For one thing, the Lib Dems won't get into power. Whatever the reason for that, the reality is that they won't and everyone knows that. Yes, if we all got together and voted for them, perhaps they could get in - but that's not going to happen. That alone is reason enough for some people.</p> <p>There's one reason for a start...</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Granted - but I would suggest that isn't the reason so many people are thinking of when they say things like "and as for the Lib Dems"... Personally I think it's more to do with this country being populated by sheep who repeat the same clapped-out mantras their families and friends have been churning out for centuries to save themselves the trouble of finding out what they are really about.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Bri</strong> replies:</em> Exactly! Humans are habitual creatures. Because Daddy voted Labour I need to! The voting age is 18 so ADULTS can make a decision on their own not based on some dusty old principles our parents/grandparents etc based their vote on. Lib Dem, I think, is the non-sheep party.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> And sadly that brings me full circle - and I guess that sort of answers my original question. So you reckon the reason why so many people disparagingly say "and as for the Lib Dems" is because it would take too much thought and effort for them to realise that there is in fact a real alternative? That would make sense, although a trifle depressing that so many people who have no idea what they're doing are allowed to vote in the first place...!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> The Liberal Democrats are not 'wishy washy'. The Liberal Democrats policies do make sense quite often. However the Liberal Democrats will not become the next government. This is largely due to their inexperience, that is the reason i would not vote for them. Also, can you leave sheep out of this debate as they are lovely, often misunderstood creatures. As for my family, they have never influenced my politics. My father voted Liberal and my mother conservative, my brothers tended to vote Plaid Cymru. So there you are, i can think for myself!!  xx</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> But who in the Consesrvative party has "experience"? Ok, there are remnants of the last Tory government still kicking around but the party as a whole (as it stands right now) also has no experience. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Olly</strong> replies:</em> I'm going to be voting for the LibDems. They're not going to get into power, but they might get enough seats to form a decent opposition which is seriously lacking in Parliament at the moment.</p> <p>And that would give them more  experience for the future.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> I don't like the Lib Dem policy of taxing the rich more. I think it's a rather easy and misguided target to pick. It's certainly as easy way to win votes - "Hey, look at how wealthy they are - if you vote us in, we'll divied up their wealth and give it to you guys!". But for me, it's just picking on a minority - and not a problematic, useless minority but a very valuable minority who already do a great deal for this country by paying a huge amount of money in taxes and, in most cases, by spending their money and employing people.</p> <p>I think there is a misconception that it is somehow the "fault" of the wealthy that other people are poor. But it doesn't work like that - wealth tends to breed wealth.</p> <p>Besides, most of them will have accountants who will rearrange things a bit so they pay much less than the Lib Dems think they'll be able to get.</p> <p>It's just too easy a solution. Too many of their policies are far too obviously only there to appeal to as many protest voters as possible, whatever the consequences.</p> <p>Come to think of it, wherever organisations are paying these high earners will ultimately foot the bill.  So it'll effectively be another tax on campanies - or in the case of certain top public-sector workers, a tax on the public purse.</p> <p>I just don't like Robin Hood politics. It doesn't seem necessary to simply pick on people who have worked their way up the ladder.</p>
