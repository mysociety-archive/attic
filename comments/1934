	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> There was a Socialist Party candidate standing in Vauxhall. <br />See their manifesto at http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/candidatesmanifestomay05.html.<br />I have to reiterate that you won't achieve socialism (i.e. a world society of common ownership based on need, not profit) by just putting an X against the Socialist candidate. You have to be prepared to organise to build that society. No political party can hand you socialism.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Keith</strong> replies:</em> Yes, but Vauxhall isn't South Shields where a) there was no socialist candidate and b) David Milliband had a 13,000 majority.  I understand the need for hard work and often wish i could do more, but the problem facing this country is that so much is geared to the 3 main parties as to who can dictate what happens.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> There was no Socialist Party candidate in my constituency, but that didn't stop me helping them. I have been a member for nearly 44 years, and there has never been a candidate where I've been living, but the work goes on.<br />You say you wish you could do more; presumably there are good reasons why you can't.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Yes, there was no whig candidate in my consituency either, nor socialist, nor communist... in fact, come to think of it, ALL the 19th century ideologies, including capitalist, seem to have been consigned to the history books now that we're in the 21st century.  Funny that.</p> <p>Funnier, though, that some people still cling to these, and funnier still that the basic governmental systems remain basically intact and unchanged!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
