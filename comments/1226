	<p><em><strong>Lorenzo</strong> replies:</em> I can see your point. To think that for each one of us posting on this forum, hundreds of of our kin died in world wars so we could live in a democracy. To end up in the sorry state we now find our selves in, we only have our low life greedy politicians to blame. They care not about their people one jot, but are only interested in their own personal power trips.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Vee</strong> replies:</em> "politicians care not about their people one jot, but are only interested in their own personal power trips"</p> <p>I doubt that it the case for most politicians - although there are a few exceptions. I don't think I would like to do a job where the media hates you, you rarely get to see your friends and family and your ideas have to be passed through redtape after redtape and even then possibly rejected by 'the party'. </p> <p>There are many other, easier ways to make a difference in the world [teaching, nursing etc]. In addition there are many other ways to go on a 'personal power trip' [manager, police...errr...teaching...] </p>

	<p><em><strong>james</strong> replies:</em> anarchy: "without ruler(s)". sounds like a good idea. i think it *is* a good idea. not voting is a step in the right direction, the first step towards freedom.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ayaz</strong> replies:</em> There would be anarchy which would develop into a dictatorship.</p>

	<p><em><strong>james</strong> replies:</em> Ayaz, your assertion that a dictatorship would arise from anarchy is a common one -- one based on the assumption that we are not already living in a dictatorship. Blair's party won the election with 36% of the vote; six in ten people registered to vote decided to participate in "democracy". People who can and do vote are not necessarily voting *for* someone or something. The Labour Party encouraged its supporters to vote *against* Howard's Tories. And remember, there has never been a plebiscite on the existence of the state. Back to the original point, in an anarchy I suspect that people would be weary of demagogues and would-be dictators. There is a danger that when small pockets of anarchy are created, they can be forcefully crushed (like in Spain, 1936 and so on) but I am an optimist and hope that people everywhere will struggle to depose tyrannical regimes and to create a peaceful world.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
