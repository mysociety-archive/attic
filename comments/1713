	<p><em><strong>yawn</strong> replies:</em> Don't be such a blind sheep.  More money is lost in this country by high-end tax evasion and legitimate tax loopholes explouted by the extreme wealthy than benefit fraud.  YOU just don't read about it that often.  YOU accept what ever the national agenda is, as set by the media.  </p> <p>Remember, not all sides of the story are always told.</p>

	<p><em><strong>David</strong> replies:</em> Why are you getting chavs involved, i hate them as much as you but they have nothing to do with politics. Also this is why your not voting, not why your not voting for (I quote) "loony leftists". Also this is a debate about why your not voting, not about your personal political beliefs, there are plent of places to insult people because of their beliefs, this is not one of them.</p>

	<p><em><strong>me again</strong> replies:</em> More money might be lost through high end tax evasion as you put it, but its my council tax that has increased by nearly 50% in the last two years to pay for local layabouts and bin men who earn more than I do but can't be arsed to get out of bed and do their jobs if there's a bank holiday in the week!!!<br />David, I haven't insulted anyone because of their beliefs, please read people's comments carefully before you criticise. Secondly, anyone who doesn't have personal political beliefs shouldn't be allowed to vote in the first place!!.. how the hell is someone supposed to exercise their franchise responsibly if they don't have an opinion of their own??... Give me strenghth...!!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
