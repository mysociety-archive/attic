	<p><em><strong>Alistair</strong> replies:</em> I actually have voted for Lord Sutch. </p> <p>The very last time he stood, in the Winchester by-election. He did a free show in the town, that I went to, so the least I could do was vote for him.</p>

	<p><em><strong>RKP</strong> replies:</em> Yes Alistair, it is easy. The Greens haven't got enough candidates otherwise you would have one in your area, wouldn't you? If you joined and wanted to get active, they'd jump at the chance.</p> <p>Of course, you could just sit on you arse and moan.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Alistair</strong> replies:</em> To RKP - Umm.. no. Wanting to vote for a party that doesn't have someone standing in my constituency doesn't mean that I have any obligation whatsoever to stand myself or lose the right to complain if I won't.</p> <p>I have no desire whatsoever to enter politics.</p> <p>Not liking the situation doesn't mean I'm just sitting on my arse and moaning, or being apathetic. I actually consider it to be a much more principled stand to not vote for candidates you don't like or support instead of the wishy-washy 'vote for whoever is closest' position.</p> <p>I'm really sick of the 'If you don't vote you don't have a right to complain' nonsense, which is just rhetoric dreamed up to try to convince people to vote for people they don't like. </p> <p>I'm going to go in to spoil a ballot, to show that I'm not just an apathetic stay-at-home, but that I'm unwilling to give an endorsement either. </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
