	<dd><p>I have just been playing with the seat calculator on the BBC Election website.  Playing with numbers I entered <br />Labour 28%of votes,<br />Tories 28% of votes <br />LibDems 36% votes<br />Others 8%<br />The seats predicted form this share out is as follows<br />Labour 275 seats<br />Tories 174 seats<br />Lib Dems 170 seats.<br />Now can someone tell me that this is a fair election and everyone vote carries the same weight?<br />I don't think so.   It would seem the constituency boundaries are rigged in favour of the Labour vote.  Something stinks in British politics.<br />The sooner Proportional Representation is intriduced the better it will be for the UK.  Politicians would then have to deal honestly with the electorate and not use spin.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Colin Rowe</strong> replies:</em> Interesting and revealing, isn't it? Two things to consider: the BBC seat calculator could have a flaw in its setup; or, in the event of that situation occurring (extremely unlikely), the Tories would have to work with the Lib Dems to keep Labour out. There's no telling where that one would end up! Given the fairly obvious slant in favour of another Labour victory, it cannot possibly mean that there will now be no time at which any other party could have a hope of winning. Option: leave the country or mount a coup!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Mark Scott</strong> replies:</em> Possibly because a lot of Tory voters vote in constituencies where there is a massive Tory majority - seats where you could allegedly put up a monkey with a blue rosette and it would get elected (like Henley on Thames perhaps?)<br />Whereas Labour and Lib-Dem seats have on the whole a thinner majority, often with basically 3-way splits?</p> <p>Bring on PR I say.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
