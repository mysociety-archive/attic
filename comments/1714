	<p><em><strong>bill</strong> replies:</em> I had a lot of sympathy with the comments in 'none of the above', except the remark that its not a secret ballot.  That comment is not correct and probably refers to the fact that a note of ther elector's number is made on the counterfoil of the ballot paper.  This does not effect the secrecy of the ballot.  the ballot papers placed in the ballot box are counted and are then sealed in secure containers.  The ballot paper counterfoils are sealed in separate containers at the polling station which may not be opened at the count. Both containers and are stored separately under Home Office control. They are kept for a short period, in case there is a claim of cheating at the election, but even then, may only be brought together and opened on the orders of a High Court Judge under controlled conditions.  We certainly don't have a perfect democracy, or even a fair democracy, since we end up with minority governments that act with dictatorial power, but secrecy of the ballot is not an issue.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
