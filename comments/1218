	<dd><p>Slap-happy about sending soldiers to war, the last Labour government is not prepared to retain the excellent Defence Medical Services for wounded men and women on their return home.  The last military hospital in Britain, Haslar Hospital, is on the verge of being closed, in the teeth of opposition from clinicians and the Defence Select Committee.  Not one of the other political parties has expressed an interest in this, or offered a policy.  No matter what one's views are on the justifications for war, surely the care of serving men and women on their return home is a given?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Hayden</strong> replies:</em> The way the government treats servicemen and women is nothing short of scandalous. It alsways has been. From lying to them about the real reasons for the tests they were undergoing at Porton Down to making a young Sergeant Tank Commander hand his body armour back in they have been treated appallingly. Whitehall is equally to blame, the British army is now the smallest its ever been and yet there are more civil servants in the MOD administering the army than ever before. Waste, mismanagement and cynical abuse on an industrial scale. What is this country i live in now? That I served in the army for? I no longer recognise it and it deeply saddens me  </p>

	<p><em><strong>Matt</strong> replies:</em> Grodon brown thinks that defence is always a good way to save money.  when he get's in he'll scrap the new carriers and scale the military down further whilst at the same time trumpeting how good we are at power projection around the world.<br />Do they all forget that to get the small numbers of special forces, including the new Recce Regiment, you need a larger pool of regular troops.</p>
