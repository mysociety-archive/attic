	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Er.. probably because (as any historian will testify) for a radical change, revolution or groundswell grassroots movement you need enough people pissed off at the same time and even at that, you'll then still need some trigger to set it all off.</p> <p>For all the inadequacies of our systems, we are all (largely speaking) doing well enough just now, so a revolution is a long way off I'm afraid.</p> <p>Most people, it seems, think we are stuck with what we have, and cannot see past that to any alternative way of running the country.</p> <p>The few who can think of change, tend (sadly) to think in terms of what has gone before and elsewhere -- communism, monarchy, dictatorships blah, blah blah.</p> <p>Perhaps the human race has stopped being creative or something, but so much seems set in stone, and that's a shame! I really don't see why we HAVE to replace our system with some other known system; I am positive we could devise something new, something that was small, cheap, efficient, effective, fair and probably more representative (or even more democratic) than any old ideology you might care to trot out.</p> <p>...nevertheless, change is extremely unlikely because everyone's middle class, and political parties are drawing into a centre together.  We have had the longest peacetime and prosperity in our history, everyone's relatively comfortable and happy enough to be apathetic. Governments can now enjoy ever longer terms for there just isn't the emotion/ passion or polarity.</p> <p>If it wasn't for the decision to attack Iraq and spread some fear of international terrorism, we'd have an even lower turn out at the ballot boxes.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rich B</strong> replies:</em> Write your response..</p> <p>dcd - "We have had the longest peacetime and prosperity in our history"</p> <p>Apart from invading and attempting to overrun Kosova and the balkans,  Afghanistan, Egypt (Suez), Argentina (Falklands).  And then contributed to world peace by selling arms to East Timor, Saudi, Israel, Kenya etc etc.   As bush will no doubt say,  Bring on an invasion of Iran for the continuation of the "post war" peace...</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
