	<dt>Politicians are just the PR wing for...</dt>
	<dd><p>Politicians are just the PR wing for the major corporations and above that the real power base  of global capitalism.</p> <p>It is apparent to anyone (above the common denominator they aim for) that their spun web of lies has equally trapped them. <br />Despite their attempts to blind us to their interests, it shines through between the lines of what they say and even how they act.</p> <p>Any objective observer can see their machinations as they manouver weak TV interviewers off any important topic into a less contentious side road.</p> <p>Like this very common news anchor and MP  Q&A session:</p> <p>Q: Why did you invade iraq, for the oil?<br />A: We came to iraq to instil peace and remove a brutal dictator ... did you want him in power?</p> <p>Q: Of course SH was bad, but there are many other bad dictators, why Iraq?<br />A: We had  intelligence that he was ultra bad, which it sadly turns out was wrong, we admit our mistakes ... but it was still for the best!</p> <p>Q: so you dont regret invading?<br />A:Ask the iraqi people, they now enjoy...blah, blah..</p> <p>let's see, questions answered .. <br />Oil : nope, used the SH moral sidestep<br />Other countries: nope, blamed faulty inteligence<br />regrets: nope, looking forward to my oil company directorship.</p> <p>in this typical exchange no questions were answered, I'm sure th eMP felt very happy with themselves. *that's 3 points to me and 0 to the interviewer* <br />But, to a public with half a brain it spells contempt.</p> <p>When I look at how my local (Labour) MP voted in the commons, it was with the PRmaster General on all issues - regardless of local opinion, For example: on the invasion of Iraq she gave assent to in all relevant votes.<br />In what way is this MP representing the views of the local people? Did the local people agree with the primeminister on every single government vote this term and the last ? well, they must because she has NEVER voted against the whip!</p> <p>In the US they openly have paid lobyists to the congress, here our 'politicians' have their payment deferred until they are out of office.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
