The  General Public, like small children, don't know what's good for them, and therefore all policy is poor policy.  While elections have ALWAYS been about selecting the least poor option, it's now worse than ever.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jim D</strong> replies:</em> I wholeheartedly agree. I followed a link onto this site from elsewhere, and I've been very interested in many of the comments...</p> <p>I have re-arranged my travel plans and taken extra time off work so that I can fly back from my job in San Francisco to vote. It's important to me, as I will be moving back to the UK during the term of the new government.</p> <p>I will be voting Labour, as they appear to me the only mainstream party with any notion of the direction the country should be going in. The blue lizards have been reduced to scrabbling for votes around non-issues that will attract tabloid coverage. The yellow lizards should, in my humble opinion, form the opposition, but lack the economic realism to be entrusted with no. 11. And while the red lizards have been disappointing to say the least, at least we know what their real agenda is.</p> <p>Please get out to vote if you can. Even spoiling your ballot paper in an imaginative way makes a statement. And at least I know that if my brand of lizards don't get elected, I'll be able to legitimately complain about the new lizards, because I went out and voted against them.</p> <p>Democracy isn't perfect, especially not in the UK, but it's all we've got at the moment.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> I agree with the original poster. I also beleive the public as a whole are uninteligent, thick sculled Neanderthals and should not interfere with the genius that are our great leaders. Let them do there job and we`ll all be the better for it. It might be an idea to take away a persons right to vote as well.   </p>

	<p><em><strong>Thomas</strong> replies:</em> Hello.  I'm the original poster.  Jim D - glad you agree with me.  Amazed though that you'd vote Labour - it is they who debased politics by forming all of their focus groups to lead policy making in the first place.  </p> <p>The reason the "blue lizards" are in such trouble is that all of their attractive policies have been adopted by Labour so they can't differentiate themselves from the incumbent swines.  Certainly agree with you on the Yellow Lizards, though.</p> <p>Tiger43 - Not sure whether you're being sarcastic or not - "great leaders" sounds sarcastic, but removing right to vote is in my opinion rather sensible.  We're all going to get the chance to vote on adopting the Euro and most of the nation is ill-equipped to make a sensible decision.  However,  you know what they say about democracy being the least bad system...</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
