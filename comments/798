Im 21 and find myself being in the biggest debt ever and i will never be able to pay that back for years due to every penny i make basically going towards all the stupid taxes and taxed products that we have to buy, the americans basically wanted to riot because the put petrol prices up there, they want to try living here, we still pay 2/3's more than they do. Taxed on petrol, cigs, income tax, council tax, car tax, the list goes on, oh well, thank god for tesco value otherwise i wouldn't be able to afford to eat, (and there is even tax on that!)</p>

	<p><em><strong>piersh</strong> replies:</em> Airport tax must be a difficult cross to bear for someone who can scarcely afford to eat. And thanks for your contribution to secondary education, healthcare, police, national security, roads etc, I for one appreciate it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>jake</strong> replies:</em> have you been to america? firstly, we may pay more, but they earn less. It all equals out. Secondly, they pay Income Tax as well, also pay local income tax, you but something in a shop, you pay national AND local tax on the product. You go to hospital, they leave you to die cos you not got the millions of pounds or an adequate insurance policy to pay for it. Britain really is not so bad</p>

	<p><em><strong>Phil</strong> replies:</em> Yes your right they do pay national and local tax on products from america but they are still cheaper there so you haven't really proved anything from that at all, yes we do have NHS which is all very well but when you have to wait months for an appointment your probably better having an insurance system like they do. I wouldn't say they earn less really, it all depends on their job at the end of the day, for example i work on computer servers, if i went to america to do that i would earn more money. I buy most things now from america because it is cheaper to have it flown over here than to walk to my local shops and buy it.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Adam</strong> replies:</em> It is cheaper, because the american economy is screwed, and the dollar is worthless. If it wasn't for the UK economy and £ being strong right now, items in america would not seem cheap!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Miss Dipsy</strong> replies:</em> Does Phil REALLY think that we'd be better off with an insurance system instead of the NHS?! So we can create a health "underclass" who cannot afford healthcare? That sounds like a great idea to me, oh yes. (And if you insist on such a self-centred worldview, that would also mean more disease which could spread to you & you family, more people who "drop out" of society and turn to drugs & criminality because they know all they have to look forward to is ill health and an early death etc etc)<br />Also, to the original poster, what exactly did you spend your money on at Uni? Are you sure you didn't just splash your student loan on drink, nights out, expensive food, clothes etc? Not saying you shouldn't spend money on your social life when you're a student, but it is a bit annoying listening to people who basically were quite stupid with their student loan complaining about it later. <br />I am saying this from the point of veiw of someone who's done the whole irresponisble spending thing during my first attempt at uni (did a year then left as I was doing the wrong course), and regrets it; I have now returned to uni, older & wiser and determined to use the money I've been given wisely! I actually have money left over from my loan which I am putting into savings to pay off my loan later. People of our parents generation had free education and non-repayable grants, but despite the fact they didn't need to repay this money, they still scrimped and saved and lived off proper "student food", rather than eating out, getting takeaways, or buying pre-prepared salad from Marks & Spencers (all things I know a lot of students do! And then wonder why they're in so much debt.). I don't completely agree with every aspect of the student finanace system, but I don't think there is a problem with asking the people who can afford to to contribute something.<br />One last thing: If you didn't pay as much tax where do you think the government would get the money to pay for everything else? (Including the heavy subsidies it pays towards your tuition fees.)<br />ps There's no VAT on food BTW.</p>
