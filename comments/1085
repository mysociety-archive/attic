They wasted billions on Iraqi war just because Blair gave in to Bush. Now they say it was to remove Saddam. Do you believe that - they still have some hidden agenda.</p> <p>I wont vote Lib-dem because of their policy of increasing local taxes (I live in Kingston with an LD MP and Lib-Dem Local Council. Terrible and they still talk of increasing tax? Heaven save us from them.</p> <p>After these three, whats left - UKP, BNP, Respect party, Greens:  All waste of vote and time to give Vote.</p>

	<p><em><strong>sh</strong> replies:</em> Blair will be gone soon, plus the party, the cabinet and the Parliamentary Labour presence is more than Tony Blair. Don't vote for Blair's slime and you lose Brown's economy. Notr voting is chucking the baby out woith the bathwater</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> To Sh, If Blair is gone and Brown takes over, is it going to be any different. Brown is sitting on economic time bomb - pensions? tuition fees? NHS cuts? And is Brown not responsible for cabinet decisions on Iraqi war - which has taken so many British lives and over 150,000 Iraqi civilians lives. These deads will always haunt Blair & Bush - whether or not their consience exists.</p>

	<p><em><strong>brian</strong> replies:</em> If we're remembering what the Tories did the last time they were in, then what about the last time labour was in (1974 - 1979)? Dead bodies not being buried, huge mountains of rubbish in the streets, strikes, no electric, food in short supply and both unemployment and inflation beginning a rocketing arise that took another two years to get under control?</p> <p>Never mind what happened the last time party "xxxxxxxx" was in power. What counts is NOW.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Sam</strong> replies:</em> In response to Mehkri - the economic time bomb existed before this government, before the government before that and in fact all the way back to the birth of the welfare state. Accusing any one party of blame is inaccurate. We have legacy systems in place in this country which are going to come to a head at some point, no matter who is in charge at the time.</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> Sam: You are right but the question now is who is realizing this problem and what they propose to do. If they want to put this problem under the carpet till it explodes, why bother to vote. I would rather work and earn.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rob</strong> replies:</em> I very much agree with Brian. Remember the "Winter of Discontent". The Conservatives have had three new leaders since then, so just saying "I won't vote X because they did such-and-such last time" isn't really helping. On that basis all parties would be incapable of winning an election within a few decades! There is no such thing as a "perfect" party where you agree with everything, but the current government has had eight years to fix any problems. In my view, the argument for not voting at the current election is to wait until the next generation of politicians with new ideas becomes more prominent in parliament (David Cameron, David Milliband etc.) Having said that, I came across a quote recently which said "Bad officials are elected by good citizens who do not vote" (I forget who said it). The argument for not voting is very strong, but in a worst-case-scenario (and unlikely scenario at that), maybe we could end up with the "wrong" party in power...</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> Rob: until Proportional representation comes in if ever, voting or not voting would get only one result in this election. Labour or Tories. Nothing else and majority disagrees with their policies. Better to spend your time in some other fruitful way. It will result in less frustration too.</p>

	<p><em><strong>raymaond</strong> replies:</em> Going by today's claims by Michael Hecht (now Howard), Tony Blair is a super liar. Tony lied at the last election about not increasing the taxes - he increased it just weeks after his election. Having won the election by deceit, he got into the habit of lying - so lied about taking us into the war in Iraq for the sake of his personal friend Bush. Now if wins again, what would he do. Let us see what he is promising us. No NHS charges - we dont have eye and dental checks so now the rest is at stake if Liars win again. No increase in taxes - he won't commit on NI this time so it is any body's guess that with pension black hole and budget deficit of 11 billion, what is going to go up in Liars win this time.</p> <p>But problem is we cant trust Tories as well. Like their family names, they can change their promises too.</p> <p>Perhaps voters in Sedgefiled offer us some help by uniting against Bliar so if Labour wins, Bliar is not there. It would be great service by the Labour supporter to their party.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Frank</strong> replies:</em> I feel like voting just to ensure that this postal voting fiasco doesn't provide us with a gerry-mandered election result.</p> <p>It is one thing choosing not to vote - quite another to have your vote highjacked.</p> <p>Spoiling ballots and boycotting the election don't have the same impact if the election process isn't what we think it is.</p>

	<p><em><strong>raymond</strong> replies:</em> Now Tony does,t want any discussion about his charecter and integrity. I used to think that these were the two most important charecteristics, the politicians wanted to emphasize. Long live politicians. </p> <p>All the more reasons that Labour supporters in Sedgefield should Vote for it if they value trust and honesty.</p> <p>Actually, it is now becoming quite a fun to watch untrustworthy Micheal Hecht (now Howard)raise the heat on another liar - Tony Blair.</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> just read that Labour candidates are asking voters to vote tactically so most senior Tory front benchers lose the election e.g. Liam Fox, Davies David and even Micheal Howard.</p> <p>Hope same thing happen to Labour candidate T Blair, G Brown, R Kelly, H Blair, C Clarke etc.</p> <p>New leadership which would then emerge may have learnt the lesson not to hood vink the voters. In return, voters might trust them too.</p>
