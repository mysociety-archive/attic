	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> "don't complain.... when Labour introduces ID cards, imposes further restrictions on my freedom, tells lies about a rogue state possessing weapons of mass destruction"</p> <p>Agreed, but the Conservatives would not be any different in this regard.</p> <p>The number one desire of ANY Government is to stay in power (because that is the only way that they can continue to control the country according to their own particular agenda). The motivations of any Party (no matter how well meaning intially) soon becomes displaced by the drive to remain in power. Even those with supposedly "good intentions" soon realise that they can't implement these intentions if they are not in power.  So ultimately all Governments become obsessed with self-preservation and, over a period of time, become prepared to do whatever it takes to remain in power.</p> <p>Thus draconian measures to monitor and control the population may seem unfeasible and undesirable while in opposition, but they soon become recognised as a means maintaining their grip on the Country, which could then be used to politcical ends.</p> <p>Don't think that something like this could happen? Just look at what is going on right now with Postal Voting in marginal seats. Why are there postal ballot request increases of 400% in marginal seats, but not anywhere else?</p> <p>Another example: Look at Labour's scathing criticism of how the Tory Goverment massaged unemployment figures to make them look much lower than they actually were (effectively accusing the Tories of 'lieing' about unemployement numbers) . Tens of thousands of people were not counted under the Conservative Government's new unemployment figures. Yet did the unemployment figures dramatically rise under a Labour Government due to the correct numbers being used? No. Labour suddenly went very quiet and just continued to use the Tory method of counting that they so criticised in opposition.</p> <p>Likewise, the Conservatives may "say" they are "concerned" or even opposed to issues like ID cards, RFID tracking, central citizen databases etc. but if they became the Government, they would soon realise the vast power that these systems would give them over the population, and they would just take advantage of the seeds that Labour had sown previously.</p> <p>Couple this with the fact that huge sections of the general public are total morons (who believe rubbish like 'ID cards will prevent Terrorism') and you have a population that will in no way resist even the most Orwellian intrusions into their life because they think that Civil Liberty / Privacy is a utopian myth (rather than any kind of human right).</p> <p></p>
