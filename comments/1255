	<dd><p>...no party is covering my minority.</p> <p>Everyone is in a minority, they just don't realise it. The huntsmen found it out recently, motorcyclists have known it for years. In part, you can't blame the politicians. If the average uninformed person is told that passtime X is dangerous, by some PC nanny state group, the politicians would be shooting themselevs in the foot to say "Leave people X alone."</p> <p>Follow the logic and see where this puts us in 20 years.</p> <p>I will actually vote at the election... but, I'll put a cross in every box. I have to be counted as 'turned out', but no party deserves my vote... plus I'll be able to go to whoever wins and say "I voted for you, why arn't you helping me out with passtime X!" ;)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anthony</strong> replies:</em> As much as it pains me to say it, you're sadly right.</p> <p>The government will continue to ban anything and anything that it thinks will get it votes, whether the evidence suggests it will help or not.</p> <p>The hysteria of the press is partly to blame about this: scary stories sell more papers.</p> <p>An interesting thing I find is that we are continuously told that our country has an increasing gun culture, when in fact this period of anti-gun hysteria is a historical abberation.</p> <p> 80 years ago the right to own guns was highly ingrained in the public consciousness. Ever since there has been creeping legislation up to the point where the majority of people seem to take the view that a farmer's guns is a symbols of conscious evil, rather than the inanimate object it is.</p> <p>It's really scary that the government and the police often lead public opinion, rather than follow it, resulting in people thinking they are making the decision for themselves.</p> <p>People like Tony Martin shouldn't be going to prison for defending his life and property, the burglars should...</p> <p>People should have the option to defend themselves in any way they see fit.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Tim</strong> replies:</em> Talking about bandwagons.  We're all aware of the current broohaha about domestic violence, well did you see the article in last week's Economist, its been in dramatic decline for years, because we're not marrying like we used to.  Problem is solving itself and all the politicians are chasing it for credit and a few votes...</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
