	<dd><p>For the first time since I have had the vote I shall not be voting, simply because, as a Libertarian, there is no serious party standing that I can support.</p> <p>I would normally vote Conservative, but I shall not be doing this this time, simply because I <em>want</em> the current Conservative Party to fail at this election. Why? Because their current agenda is totally unimaginative and not even remotely radical enough. Furthermore, Michael Howard has shown himself to be a crass populist (see his comments re: the Boris Johnson / Liverpool affair), an egomaniac, and a bandwagon-jumper extraordinaire (immigration? booooooring!)</p> <p>I cannot <em>risk</em> voting Conservative <em>even though I hate all the other parties a thousand times more</em> because there's a small chance they could get in, and if they did so, they would have a mandate to implement the current lacklustre manifesto, and the cause of genuinely radical libertarian conservatism<br />would be set back decades - far better than they fail now, and come back when they've seriously thought things through. Even in the (more likely) event of a Conservative defeat, a vote for them now might be enough to convince the party that there is enough support for the current leadership to keep on going - which, clearly, I don't want.</p> <p>And before you say it, I can't vote UKIP, because, let's face it, they are a bunch of nutters who belong in a nut-house.</p> <p>So, it looks like I'll have to grin and bear another five years of freedom-hating statist buffoons.</p> <p>Anarchy for the UK!</p> <p>- Dr. Mabuse</p>

	<p><em><strong>JR</strong> replies:</em> You're a Libertarian and you would normally vote CONSERVATIVE? Does not compute, Captain. <br />Conservatives, especially the Republican ones in the US, are minded to force their preferences on others with weaponry!<br />This includes Conservatives who call themselves New Labour, of course.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Dr. Mabuse</strong> replies:</em> The fundamental tenet of libertarianism is the <em>reduction of the size of the state</em> - less state interference in our economic lives and our personal lives. The Conservative Party are the only (serious) party that endorse the former, though they are lacking in the other.</p> <p>Even though the Republican Party was originally based on the Tory Party, it is far less libertarian than today's Tory Party - e.g. the Republicans endorse trade tariffs against imports in selected industries - which is a completely statist, anti-free trade, and left-wing thing to do.</p> <p>The libertarian party in the US is called, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Libertarian Party - there is no direct equivalent here - the Conservatives are the closest we have.  There are no conservatives who call themselves New Labour, btw - New Labour has done nothing to reduce the size of the state and everything to increase it.</p> <p>hth.<br /> <br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>FSOBR</strong> replies:</em> Libertarian - never have heard of it - are there any books about it?</p> <p>So to reduce the size of the state - what does this mean? i'm presumably state control / power - but what then? Where does all this dissolved control / power go to?</p> <p></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
