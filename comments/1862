	<p><em><strong>G. Holt</strong> replies:</em> Not many expats retain a vote when they emigrate, but provided application is made within 15 years of emigrating I bslieve it is quite possible to retain a vote in the UK. I didn;t realize this until it was too late for me to apply.  If I had had a vote I would have given it to the Liberal Democrats because that Party had indicated that they would at long, long last right the disgraceful pension injustice they suffer if they emigrate to Australia, New Zealand, Canada or Souht Africa.  If they settle in virtually any other country in the world they remain entitled to the same Age Pension as those who remain in the UK.  But if they settle in one of these four countries, immediately their pension ceases to be Index llinked, so that with  the affect of inflation each year if become worth less. It seems unblievable that this blatant discrimination has continued year after year.  It is totally illogical  thatthe country of residence should affect the amount of one's pension.  It's as crazy as if the Government were to ordain that  all dark haired people were to receive less than fair haired ones! Let's hope that the Liberal Democratat will remember their promise and use their voting power to force Labour to rectify this glaring injustice.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Richard Dyason</strong> replies:</em> Firstly, Australia is not my 'adpted' country - I hate it.</p> <p>Secondly I too feel disenfranchised, but DO vote in Australia - Laobor(sic) of course.</p> <p>Thirdly, I will be returning to the beautiful country of England in September this year. My wife and I are having a narrowboat built in Mirfield West Yorkshire. We shall also be puchasing a home in the UK.</p> <p>All of this paid for by the Australian Governmnet - Quite a laugh eh?</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
