	<p><em><strong>Andrew</strong> replies:</em> no, they dont have to go that far. just set up a system that is inline with how we interact socially nowadays. THe old polling station method is dated and doesnt fit the pace of today's society. Hence the massive increase in postal votes.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jax</strong> replies:</em> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p> <p>I work in technology and I know as well as the rest of us techies that serious fraud CAN occur if we start digitising the voting system.<br />We can't implement that kind of thing safely without well-tested means of securing and validating biometric data, and thats a little way off.</p> <p>The current procedure works, we had a higher turnout back in the 50's,  the system worked then, walking for about 20 minutes is not too difficult and you should see it as your democratic duty.</p> <p>I would like to see the parties sing tho, that'd be funny.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Benedict White</strong> replies:</em> I think that we should vote over the weekend the way we used to. that way more people would be free to vote.</p> <p>It is vitaly important that the ballot is kept secret and the only way to do that is in the polling booth.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Martin</strong> replies:</em> Surely if you can't make the effort to walk the (generally) short distance to register your opinion on the next 4/5 years of government, or send off a form for postal voting, then that is apathy?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom</strong> replies:</em> Personally i dont want the average pop idol viewer voting. If they are too lazy to walk a few minutes to a polling station then they definately havent put in the effort to vote carefully.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Marc</strong> replies:</em> If you can't be bothered to walk to make such an important  choice then we are probably all better off without your voice being counted! Maybe  we should all be demanding a farer voting system that might encourage  the  dissalusioned to vote. There is no hope or point of pandering to the bone idle!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Stuart Robinson</strong> replies:</em> It seems that many people are obsessed with patriotic duty to walk a few hundred yards to the nearest polling station. But this is missing the point - the author did not say he didn't want to walk, he said he wanted to vote via SMS.</p> <p>Technically, this would be impossible to implement, as SMS is a flawed system as it is, and is definitely not suited to voting. However, in time a secure system may come about, in which case it should be used. If one wants to raise participation in the electoral franchise, then we should be increasing the methods by which one can particpate.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Emily</strong> replies:</em> Patriotic duty is completely irrelevant. It's the fact that we'll be living in this country for the next four years, love it or hate it. It's no good moaning at the TV if you wanted to vote but were put off by the thought of having to walk down the road once every four years. And that's what SMS voting seems to be about, because it isn't as if there aren't enough ways to vote already. There are polling stations all over the place which are open before and after the working day, transport is provided for those who can't make it there themselves and anyone can use a postal vote if it's still inconvenient. SMS voting, if it did work, would make the whole process so easy that people could decide on a whim that they'll vote for a party that seems all right, do it in a matter of seconds and then put the kettle on, just the way they do for Pop Idol. That doesn't seem like a very effective way to raise participation in the electoral franchise to me.</p>
