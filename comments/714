	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> But which one?! Aside from the lies we all know about in the past, it's even harder right now to tell lies from spin from reality. Take the Tory spending plans. After the reading I have done they DO seem to add up; however Tony B.Liar and Gordon Brown are touring the country telling all and sundry that they don't. Is this not an outright lie?! Inidentally I wouldn't vote Tory either...</p>

	<p><em><strong>steve</strong> replies:</em> The way I look at it is this: find a few key issues that really matter to you and research them as thoroughly as you can.  Decide based on what you find out.  </p> <p>Also, feeling there's no point voting because of spin is one thing but even more important than that is to look and see what people did historically to allow us all to have the right to vote and what is at stake in the future.  People in Iraq, Zimbabwe and other 'bad' places would die to have the chance to vote in free elections, here people have the chance to vote and try to make a change yet feel not voting is OK because 'there is nothing to vote for' - there is always a reason to vote, even if it is out of respect for the people who fought to the death so you could vote.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Steve, it is wrong of you to introduce the guilt trip angle of "people died so you could vote". Entirely and completely wrong. People died so we could have the CHOICE to vote. </p> <p>And as you say this ISN'T Zimbabwe (although one could be forgiven for mistaking the two after recent headlines) so the point is immaterial.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SW</strong> replies:</em> Incidentally, don't forget that countless people DID die in Iraq - although not so they could have a free vote. We killed them...</p>

	<p><em><strong>jb</strong> replies:</em> But they died for a good cause.......<br />so we can have oil for another few years before it all runs out anyway.<br />And do Uncle Georges pals companies could make a few more million dollars in the process....</p> <p>Do Politicians really believe that we are all completely stupid????</p> <p>Oh I forgot we can't win,<br />either don't vote and they stay in power, or Vote one of the lying buggers in anyway...... sigh<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Kevin Ward</strong> replies:</em> Well maybe you should think about the greater good of the country. I am a fairly passionate supporter of politics and yet I know my individual vote won't go very far to improving my life. It's not about personal gain though, it's about standing up and being counted. The public generally gets the politicians it deserves and not voting plays a large role in that.</p>

	<p><em><strong>steve</strong> replies:</em> sb I'm not trying to guilt trip you, <strong>it's a fact that people died so you and I could vote</strong>.  To suggest that parties aren't worth voting for is to belittle the achievment of these people. </p> <p>The current political environment is as it is because of people like you and others who visit this site to post some pathetic excuses or other rather than using the time to vote or challenge the government to do something to improve the political environment of the country. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris</strong> replies:</em> Well said Steve. This site is a pathetic display of toys being thrown out of prams, presumably in the belief that Labour (ie Tony Blair) is sitting at home reading their messages. Grow up! </p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Who exactly died primarily to attain / maintain democracy? Are we talking WWII, here? I don't think that's exactly how it worked.  And it has been a while since anything like that took place, so it is quite possible that things have stagnated to the point that the current political parties are not what they should be. Believing that would in no way be an insult to anyone who died in any war - it's about modern politics.</p> <p>It's a shame when people feel the need to basically label everyone as childish who sees things differently from their own view. The variety and complexity of many of the reasoning behind the posts on this site suggest rather more than straight whinging or some kind of group tantrum. If you consider not voting as being a valid choice out of the options available in an election and you choose that option based upon your own political views, that's not pathetic or childish.</p> <p>Meaningful political debate is a useful tool and may well lead to some people, even those who have posted on here, eventually voting because of the discussion that has ensued. That is unless the replies consist of "you're a pathetic child, just go and vote you lazy bastard" which is no more helpful than the "I hate politicians" posts.</p>
